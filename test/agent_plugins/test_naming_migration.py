"""Docs vocabulary and the prepared skill-rename retirement step (W10).

**Validates: Requirements 21.4, 21.5**

Two things are asserted here, and neither resolves a maintainer decision.

The **docs vocabulary rule** — "event plugin" and "agent plugin" are always
qualified, bare "plugin" only inside a document whose title already scopes it —
is checked mechanically, because a rule enforced by review alone decays.

The **retirement step** for renaming ``cao-plugin`` to ``cao-event-plugin`` is
built and tested while its rename map stays empty. M4 is unresolved, so
activating it must be a data edit rather than a migration project; the tests
below drive the mechanism through a synthetic rename to prove that.
