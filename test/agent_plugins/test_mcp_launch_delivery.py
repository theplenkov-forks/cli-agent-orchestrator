"""Plugin MCP servers must appear in each provider's REAL launch artifact.

Reproduced by review on #584, and the reason this file exists at all:

> "the all-provider tests need to inspect real launch commands rather than
> treating ``collect_plugin_mcp_servers()`` as delivery."

The pre-existing equivalence suite asked ``mcp_delivery`` what it *would*
deliver. That is a tautology with respect to the actual defect: the merge ran in
``install_service`` against an in-memory profile, ``_write_context_file``
persisted the untouched raw text, and Claude Code, Codex, Kimi, Antigravity and
Cursor each called ``load_agent_profile()`` **again** at launch — so the merged
entry was gone by the time the command was built. Copilot never consulted the
profile for MCP at all. Every assertion here therefore reads the command string
or config file the provider really produces.

Mutation-verified: removing the ``with_plugin_mcp`` wrapper from a provider makes
that provider's case fail.

    Found by self-audit on #584, in the same class as review 5222539218's item 5
    (Kimi) and review 3's ``GROK_URL_TRANSPORTS``: ``_map_entry`` emits the
    Agent Plugins / MCP spelling verbatim, and a provider whose own config format
    names the same transport differently receives a value it does not use.

    <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-mcp-servers>`_).

    * ``stdio`` needs **no** translation. The vendor documents ``Local`` and
      ``STDIO`` as working the same way and recommends ``stdio`` precisely for
      cross-client portability, so the common case was never broken. An earlier
      draft of this finding claimed otherwise; the documentation does not support
      that and the claim is withdrawn.
    * ``streamable-http`` **is** foreign. Copilot names that transport ``http``,
      so a schema-valid remote plugin server reached ``--additional-mcp-config``
      with a ``type`` Copilot has no case for.

    The matrix fixture above is stdio, so it cannot see this: it never takes the
