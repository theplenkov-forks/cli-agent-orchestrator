"""Structural properties of the vendored schema pin (W2).

**Validates: Requirements 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 23.1; Property P11**

``test_schema_pin.py`` already asserts the
things that can be checked by *reading the bytes*: the recorded hashes match, the
plugin schema is closed, ``--check`` fails on tampering or on a missing file, and
validation completes with every socket blocked. None of that is repeated here.

What this file adds is agreement **between** the artifacts that describe the pin —
``PIN.json``, the vendored files, the vendoring script, and the validator's own
notion of which schema id it supports. Each of those states the same facts, and
nothing previously required them to agree, so any one could drift and the suite
would stay green while CAO validated against a schema it no longer claimed to
support.

Deliberately **not** duplicated: ``test_vendored_bytes_hash_to_recorded_value``,
``test_manifest_schema_closes_additional_properties``,
``test_offline_check_*`` (four), ``test_valid_manifest_validates_with_sockets_blocked``,
``test_validator_builds_with_sockets_blocked`` and
``test_registry_refuses_to_retrieve_an_unvendored_ref`` — all already in
``test_schema_pin.py`` as ``test_vendored_bytes_hash_to_the_recorded_value``,
``test_vendored_plugin_schema_is_closed``, ``test_check_*``,
``test_valid_plugin_validates_with_sockets_blocked``,
``test_unknown_schema_is_rejected_offline_rather_than_fetched`` and
``test_remote_ref_resolution_is_refused``.
