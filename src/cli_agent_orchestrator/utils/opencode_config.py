    OpenCode treats the filename stem of an agent ``.md`` file as its agent ID
    (used for ``--agent <id>`` and keyed by the same value under
    ``agent.<id>`` in ``opencode.json``).

    Since the id becomes the ``<id>.md`` filename, any path separator left in it
    would traverse out of ``OPENCODE_AGENTS_DIR``, so both ``/`` and ``\\`` are
    flattened to ``__`` (backslash included because it is a separator on
    Windows). ``install_service`` now *rejects* a resolved profile ``name:``
    containing a separator outright, so this flatten is defence in depth rather
    than the primary guard — and a namespaced ``name:`` is no longer installable.

    The output is the single source of truth for:

    - the installed ``<id>.md`` filename under ``OPENCODE_AGENTS_DIR``
    - the ``agent.<id>.tools`` key written to ``opencode.json``
    - the value passed to ``opencode --agent <id>`` at runtime

    Idempotent: inputs that contain no separator are returned unchanged.

    THE ID SPACE IS STILL NOT INJECTIVE, for a reason that has nothing to do
    with separators. Two DIFFERENT profile files carrying the same resolved
    frontmatter ``name:`` produce the same id, and the id is a key on disk (the
    ``<id>.md`` filename and the ``agent.<id>`` section of ``opencode.json``),
    so whichever installs second silently overwrites the first. The opencode
    install path guards against that via
    ``_guard_installed_copy_ownership`` in ``services/install_service.py``,
    which fails loud rather than overwriting.

    The separator collapse itself is no longer a live collision source on the
    install path: ``_write_context_file`` runs ``validate_path_component`` on the
    resolved name earlier in the same ``install_agent`` call, which REJECTS any
    name containing ``/`` or ``\\``, so a separator-bearing name never reaches
    this function there and the flatten is the identity for everything that
    does. It stays as defence in depth for any future caller that has not been
    through that validation.

#
# OpenCode's shared ``opencode.json`` is edited in place: ``upsert_mcp_server``
# is upsert-only and there is no delete. Two consequences the helpers below fix:
#
#   * Removal (Finding 1). A plugin server no longer delivered must be DISABLED,
#     not deleted (CAO must never delete a key it may not own) and not left
#     ``enabled: true`` (its ``command`` points at a ``PLUGIN_ROOT`` that removal
#     just deleted, so OpenCode would try to spawn a missing executable on every
#     launch). ``disable_mcp_server`` writes a JSON boolean ``false`` — OpenCode
#     1.18.15 gates the spawn on a strict ``enabled === false``, so ``"false"``,
#     ``0`` or a missing ``type`` would NOT stop it (see
#     ``docs/issues/573-agent-plugins/opencode-verification.md``).
#
#   * Install-side clobber (Finding 2). Writing a plugin-derived server whose
#     name collides with a user's hand-written entry would silently destroy the
#     user's config. ``is_cao_owned_mcp_entry`` decides whether an existing entry
#     is safe to overwrite.
#
# PROVENANCE IS A HEURISTIC, NOT A FACT. ``opencode.json`` records no owner, so
# the only signal available without persisted state (install-record / marker
# key — design.md §10a options 1 and 2, deliberately out of scope here) is that
# a CAO-delivered plugin server's ``command``/``environment`` were expanded from
# ``${PLUGIN_ROOT}``/``${PLUGIN_DATA}`` and therefore point INSIDE the plugin
# store. A *stale* CAO entry written under a different ``CAO_HOME_DIR`` points at
# the OLD store and is thus indistinguishable from a user's entry; it is treated

       twice). Overwriting an entry equal to the candidate is a no-op anyway.
    2. Its command resolves **inside the plugin store**, whatever its
       ``enabled`` state. The plugin store is a CAO-managed directory that only
       CAO ever writes into, so a command rooted there is CAO's own delivery by

       the plugin store — a server CAO delivered and then disabled on a prior
       uninstall. Re-enabling it on reinstall is safe.

    Anything else — an entry that differs and does not resolve into the plugin
    store — is treated as user-owned and must NOT be overwritten.

    Reproduced by review on #584: condition 2 was previously gated on
    ``enabled is False``, so a force update that changed a plugin server's
    command, args or env made the entry differ from both the candidate and the
    disabled shape. CAO then misclassified **its own** enabled entry as
    user-owned, left the stale v1 command in ``opencode.json`` and dropped the
    agent's tool grant because the v2 entry was skipped. The same path broke a
    lexicographic winner transition between two plugins. Widening the ownership
    test to any in-store command lets CAO update its own entries while leaving
    the guard at full strength for genuinely user-authored ones, which by
    definition do not point into CAO's plugin store.
