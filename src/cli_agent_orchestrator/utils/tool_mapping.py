"""Tool mapping from CAO vocabulary to provider-native tool names.

CAO defines a universal tool vocabulary (execute_bash, fs_read, fs_write, fs_list, fs_*,
web_fetch, @builtin, @cao-mcp-server) that is translated to each provider's native tool names.
This module provides the mapping and a function to compute which native tools to BLOCK

    The one matching rule shared by every place that turns ``allowedTools`` into
    provider MCP policy — today ``services/install_service.py`` (OpenCode's
    ``agent.<id>.tools`` map) and ``providers/grok_cli.py`` (Grok's
    ``MCPTool(<server>__*)`` rules). ``docs/agent-plugins.md`` documents three
    ways to name a server — ``"*"``, an explicit ``@server-name``, or **a
    matching glob** such as ``@plugin-*`` — and both sites implemented only exact
    membership, so the documented glob authorized nothing. Two independently
    written matchers is exactly the drift that produced that gap, so there is one.

    Three properties are load-bearing:

    * **Expansion is over the concrete names given**, never over the pattern.
      A caller passes the servers actually delivered/configured for this agent
      and gets back a subset of them, so a pattern matching nothing yields
      nothing. Interpolating the pattern into provider policy instead would
      pre-authorize whatever later answered to that name.
    * **Case-sensitive**, via :func:`fnmatch.fnmatchcase`. Plain
      :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` case-folds wherever ``os.path.normcase`` does, so
      on such a host ``@PLUGIN-*`` would silently widen to ``plugin-tools``.
    * **Exact membership is preserved independently of the glob.** A name equal
      to the reference matches even when it contains characters ``fnmatch``
      treats as syntax (``@srv[1]`` grants a server literally named ``srv[1]``),
      so the previous behaviour is a strict subset of this one.

    This does **not** grant anything on its own and must not be made to: a
    pattern reaches here only because a human wrote it into a profile's
    ``allowedTools``, which is what keeps a plugin install from widening any
    allowlist (issue #573 AC7). ``resolve_allowed_tools`` decides what is in the
    allowlist; this only expands what is already there.

    Args:
        allowed_tools: The resolved CAO allowlist.
