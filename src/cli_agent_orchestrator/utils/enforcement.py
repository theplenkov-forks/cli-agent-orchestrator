"""How each provider enforces a CAO ``allowedTools`` policy.

One table, consumed by the launch confirmation gate, the server-side warning
in ``terminal_service`` and the documentation tables (a test keeps
``SECURITY.md`` and ``docs/tool-restrictions.md`` in step with it), so the
answer to "does the Blocked list mean anything on this provider?" cannot
drift between the code and what the operator is shown.

Three levels:

* ``NATIVE``: the provider runtime refuses denied tools itself (deny flags,
  an install-time permission block, or an allowlist in the agent file).
* ``PROMPT``: CAO can only tell the agent not to use the tools; the agent may
  still call them.
* ``NONE``: CAO passes no restriction at all, and the provider auto-approves
  tool calls. A restricted profile on such a provider runs unrestricted.
