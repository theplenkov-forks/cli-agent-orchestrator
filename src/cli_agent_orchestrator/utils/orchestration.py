"""Shared implementation for CAO's in-session orchestration primitives.

This module is the SINGLE seam behind both entry points that let one agent
orchestrate another: the ``assign``/``handoff``/``send_message``/
``delete_terminal`` tools registered on ``cao-mcp-server``
(``mcp_server/server.py``) and the ``cao agent ...`` CLI commands
(``cli/commands/agent.py``, issue #616). Both are thin wrappers that call the
functions here and render the result for their own transport (an MCP tool
return value vs. stdout/exit-code) -- neither entry point re-implements this
logic, so behavior can never drift between "orchestrate via MCP" and
"orchestrate via the CLI escape hatch" (e.g. when a terminal's MCP child
process has died but its shell is still alive).

HTTP-only: like ``mcp_server/``, every function here reaches Backplane state
exclusively through cao-server's FastAPI surface over ``API_BASE_URL`` -- or,
for a cross-node placement, over the target node's own base URL resolved by
``_resolve_target_base_url`` (``requests``) -- never through ``clients.tmux`` /
``clients.database``.
This module lives under ``utils/`` (not ``mcp_server/``) specifically so the
CLI can import it without pulling in ``mcp_server/server.py``'s module-level
FastMCP server construction and tool registration (a side-effecting, heavier
import a short-lived CLI process has no reason to pay for).

    ``allowed_tools`` for the server to create the worker with) and the

    for a terminal ``_handoff_impl`` already created and reported). Response
    interpretation -- timeout vs worker-error vs malformed-200 vs success -- is
    identical either way, so it lives here once rather than twice.

    When ``payload`` carries ``reuse_terminal_id``, an error response's
    ``terminal_id`` falls back to that value: the caller already knows this
    terminal exists, so there is no reason to lose track of it even if a

    ``base_url``/``target_host`` carry ``_handoff_impl``'s cross-node placement

    """Implementation of handoff logic.

    Single-seam refactor (issue #312, N0). This is an HTTP client; it MUST NOT
    import services/clients. Its former six granular round-trips (create ->
    poll-ready -> input -> poll-complete -> output -> exit/delete) are
    collapsed into ONE call to the combined server-side ``POST
    /terminals/run-step`` endpoint, whose handler runs the shared
    ``run_agent_step`` substrate. Observable behavior is preserved (BR-8): same
    HandoffResult shape + success/failure semantics, same codex CAO_TERMINAL_ID
    fast-fail, same timeout contract, terminal auto-torn-down on success.

    Codex prompt-shaping (the [CAO Handoff] banner) stays CALLER-SIDE here: it
    depends on the CALLING PROCESS's ``CAO_TERMINAL_ID`` env var (the MCP
    subprocess, or a ``cao agent handoff`` shell), which the cao-server process
    does not have. We shape the prompt before the single call and pass the
    already-shaped text to the substrate, which sends it verbatim. This is the
    one behavior-equivalence risk flagged in the plan; keeping the shaping
    caller-side is the choice that preserves the exact existing codex banner
    regardless of which entry point (MCP tool or CLI command) calls this.

    ``on_terminal_id`` / ``wait`` (review on PR #634, issue #616): the MCP
    ``handoff`` tool calls this with neither set, taking the single-call path
    below exactly as written above -- BEHAVIOR UNCHANGED, still BR-8.
    ``cao agent handoff`` passes ``on_terminal_id`` so an operator who kills a
    blocking handoff has a real terminal_id to recover with (``cao agent
    status``/``result``/``cancel``) instead of blind-retrying into a second
    worker, and ``wait=False`` (``--no-wait``) to return immediately after
    creation without waiting, extracting, or tearing down at all.

    ``idempotency_key``: NO CALLER PASSES THIS TODAY, deliberately. It is
    forwarded to ``_create_terminal``'s early-terminal-id create call, which
    forwards it to the server; the server persists
    ``(idempotency_key -> terminal_id)`` atomically with the terminal row (see
    ``terminal_service.create_terminal``'s docstring), so a caller supplying the
    SAME key on a retry gets back the terminal the first, already-committed
    attempt created rather than a second worker.

    That deduplicates terminal CREATION only. It does NOT deduplicate the
    submission: the message is delivered after the worker exists, and nothing
    records whether that delivery happened, so a retry can neither safely skip
    the send (which would silently drop the task) nor safely repeat it (which
    would run it twice). A ``cao agent handoff --idempotency-key`` flag briefly
    existed here and was REMOVED for exactly that reason (review on PR #634):
    a user-facing retry-safety contract that only half holds is worse than none,
    and #616's "killing the CLI process does not lose the job or its result"
    needs the durable run record, not this key alone.

    The parameter and its tests stay because #715 builds the run record on top
    of this substrate and will re-expose the key once a retry can resolve to an
    existing RUN. Unreachable, not dead -- do not delete it as unused.

    ``target_host`` (one-agent-per-pod topology): when set, the single
    run-step call goes to THAT node's cao-server instead of the local one, so
    the worker terminal (and its fresh session) is created on the remote node.
    The provider is resolved from the remote node's own profile store —
    failing FAST if the node is unreachable (never guess a provider and then
    post work to a dead node) — no ``session_name``/``caller_id`` is sent
    (the supervisor's session and terminal row exist only on the supervisor's
    node, and handoff is blocking — the result returns in this HTTP response,
    no callback needed), and ``working_directory`` is interpreted on the
    remote filesystem. ``use_worktree`` is rejected together with
    ``target_host`` (same rule as assign — see the target_host field
    description). A failed/timed-out remote step leaves its terminal alive
    server-side, which on a CAO_MAX_TERMINALS=1 worker pod occupies the pod's
    only slot — so remote failures trigger a best-effort DELETE of that
    terminal here, and the failure message carries the manual cleanup route
    when even that fails. Omitting ``target_host`` preserves local behavior
    byte-for-byte.

    ``target_host`` is ALSO rejected together with the three CLI-only inputs
    above (``on_terminal_id``, ``wait=False``, ``idempotency_key``), and that
    combination is refused rather than made to work because the two features
    were built against different code paths and silently mixing them targets
    the WRONG NODE. Those inputs route through ``_create_terminal`` and
    ``_send_direct_input_handoff``, both of which post to ``API_BASE_URL``
    unconditionally: a remote handoff carrying them would create the worker
    locally and then drive it remotely (or the reverse), which no caller could
    detect from a success return. Rejecting is the same call upstream already
    made for ``use_worktree`` for the same reason. Separately, the idempotency
    mapping is per-node local state (``idempotency_keys`` is a node-local
    table), so a keyed retry that lands on a different ``target_host`` could
    not dedupe even if the plumbing were threaded.

    Uses the remote node's ``POST /sessions`` deferred-init path: a fresh

    node) and the task is delivered once the remote provider initializes. The
    remote node resolves the provider from its OWN installed profile store
    (``provider`` is deliberately omitted from the request).

    Callback routing: assign is non-blocking, so results come back via the
    worker's ``send_message``. The worker's node has no DB row for this
    supervisor terminal, so we inject ``CAO_CALLBACK_URL`` and
    ``CAO_CALLBACK_TERMINAL_ID`` into the remote terminal's environment. Plain
    remote assign uses this node's ``CAO_ADVERTISED_URL``; elastic assign passes
    its authenticated broker gateway as ``callback_url`` so workers never learn
    the supervisor control API URL.

    Elastic assign also passes the broker-issued ``remote_session_name``. The
    broker binds memory authorization to that immutable session identity before
    the worker exists, avoiding a registration race with deferred initialization.

    ``ready_wait_seconds`` > 0 waits for the target's ``/health`` before posting
    (see ``_wait_remote_ready``). It defaults to 0, which keeps every existing
    caller byte-identical: a ``target_host`` naming a long-running pod is either
    up or genuinely broken, and a node that is down should still fail in seconds
    rather than after a wait. Only a caller that just CREATED the target - the
