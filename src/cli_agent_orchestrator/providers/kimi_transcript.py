"""Shared semantic classifier for Kimi CLI / Kimi Code terminal transcripts.

Both the legacy MoonshotAI ``kimi-cli`` TUI and the current "Kimi Code"
(agent-core-v2) TUI render their transcript with the same broad grammar — a
bullet per assistant turn, grey styling for reasoning, a status/footer row, a
composer frame — but they disagree on the *glyphs* and on which rows are chrome:

======================  ==========================  =========================

live working indicator  bare moon phase ``🌑…🌘``   braille ``⠙ working…``
idle tip row            —                           ``🌕 · Tip: …`` (NOT work)
composer                ``💫`` / ``✨`` prompt       boxed ``╭─╮ │ > │ ╰─╯``
footer                  ``HH:MM yolo agent (…)``    ``context: N% (…)``
banner                  ``Welcome to Kimi Code CLI!``  ``Welcome to Kimi Code!``
======================  ==========================  =========================

Before this module every consumer (``get_status``, ``get_status_from_screen``,
``extract_last_message_from_script``, ``_extract_without_input_box``,
``extract_session_context``) re-declared its own glyph assumptions, so each new
Kimi release had to be fixed in five places and the fixes drifted apart. This
module is the single place those assumptions live.

The classifier deliberately works on the pair ``(raw_line, clean_line)``: the
clean text answers "what is this row", the ANSI-preserved text answers "how is
it styled", and the two Kimi releases are only separable when both are
available (a ``●`` is a final answer or a thinking bullet *purely* by colour).

#:
#: A braille codepoint that is not a frame is ordinary text: reproduced, the

# Chrome / structure

# Every rule below is *structural*: a row is chrome because of where it sits in
# the row, what styles it, or how the whole row is shaped — never because a
# piece of UI vocabulary happens to appear somewhere inside it.
#
# That distinction is the whole point. A substring test for
# "connecting to mcp servers" classifies the assistant sentence
# "● connecting to mcp servers is not the problem" as BOOT_CHROME, and because
# `_locate_response_region` treats BOOT_CHROME as a response-end anchor the
# answer is then truncated at that line. The same holds for
# "The reported context: 50% is expected." and STATUS_FOOTER. Measured on the
# A0 captures, all of these are ordinary assistant prose.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Welcome banner ------------------------------------------------------
#
# Kimi Code draws its startup banner inside a `│ … │` box whose frame is colour
# 111; the composer below it is the same shape in colour 240. The frame colour
# is therefore the discriminator between the two boxes, and it also keeps a
# Markdown table row (`│ a │ b │`, unstyled) out of this rule.

# the banner. Covers both the 0.43.1 box (frame colour 111) and the older build
# that renders `Welcome to Kimi Code CLI!` in a colour-33 box. Structural: the
# box framing plus the banner text, so an answer line that merely says
# "Welcome to Kimi Code! is the literal banner" is not caught.
#
# Deliberately NOT end-anchored on a closing `│`. Measured on the 0.43.1
# capture, the banner row is
#   `ESC[38;5;111m│ESC[39m  ESC[38;5;111m▐█▛█▛█▌ESC[39m  ESC[1m…Welcome to Kimi Code!ESC[0m` + padding
# — the right edge is not drawn on this row, it is space-padded to the terminal
# width. Requiring a closing edge made this rule dead for the very banner it
# documents, which only stayed covered because the raw path also has the
# colour-111 frame marker. The screen path (`get_status_from_screen`) receives
# escape-free rows, so it had no coverage at all.

# The optional leading braille glyph is measured, not decorative: Kimi draws

# "Use ctrl-o to hide or reveal tool output if needed." in the answer.
#
# The rotating tips are *corroborating* evidence, not independent segments. A
# real status row carries one measured field (the git branch, the agent segment,
# the context indicator) plus a tip; an ordinary answer can mention the tips
# themselves, and "Use ctrl-o to hide or reveal tool output and shift-tab to Plan
# mode." matched two of them, classified as STATUS_FOOTER and truncated the rest
# of the answer. When the row is styled, the tip must carry the footer's own

    """Classify a whole transcript, in sequence.

    Row-by-row classification cannot answer the question the extractor actually
    asks — "is this JSON row the payload of the tool call above it, or the
    agent's answer?" — because neither a tool payload row nor a wrapped user
    message carries a marker of its own (Kimi Code draws the former dim and
    indented, exactly like an indented prose continuation, and the latter as
    plain text). This is the D6 production defect: the user message's second
    line, the tool header and the tool payload were all published as the answer.

    Four things are tracked, and all of them are asymmetric in the same way —
    each can only become active on a **positively identified** row, and each can
    only be left on positive evidence, never on a heuristic about layout:

    **User submission (D6-F1).** Opens only on a positively identified submitted
    row — the sparkle-prefixed, colour-222 shape the renderer draws. A wrapped
    message's continuation rows repeat the colour 222 without the sparkle, so a
    colour-222 row *continues* an established block but can never start one:
    otherwise a colour-222 row inside an answer or a code block would look like a
    fresh submission and move the extraction start past earlier answer content.
    Unstyled prose after a submission is *not* absorbed (the legacy table case).

    **Reasoning.** Opens on a :data:`KimiLineKind.THINKING_BULLET`. A wrapped
    reasoning line repeats the reasoning styling (grey 244 / italic) without the
    bullet, so those rows are absorbed as reasoning rather than published.
    Arbitrary *unstyled* prose after a thinking bullet is not absorbed.

    **Tool output (D6-F3).** Opens on a :data:`KimiLineKind.TOOL_CALL` row.
    Inside it, rows that would otherwise be ``CONTENT`` become
    :data:`KimiLineKind.TOOL_CHROME`, and blank rows are kept as blanks without
    ending it (payloads are often blank-line separated). It ends only on
    positive renderer evidence that the row is not payload — see
    :func:`_ends_tool_block`. Payload cannot certify its own end by resembling
    chrome, and an escape-free capture fails closed rather than publishing
    payload as the answer.

    **Context-sensitive UI kinds.** ``TRUST_DIALOG`` and ``APPROVAL_DIALOG`` are
    confirmed against the whole capture before any of the above runs, so a row
    that merely *quotes* a dialog is ordinary content — see
    :func:`_confirm_context_kinds`.

    ``clean_lines`` may be supplied by a caller that already stripped SGR.
