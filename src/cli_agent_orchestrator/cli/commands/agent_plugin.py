"""``cao plugin`` — manage Agent Plugins (the portable open specification).

Structured as a direct sibling of ``cli/commands/skills.py``: the same
``click.group()`` shape, the same ``raise click.ClickException(str(exc))``
convention, and the same post-mutation refresh of baked agent prompts.

**Naming is not settled.** design.md records the verb as maintainer decision
**M1** — ``cao plugin`` (recommended) versus ``cao agent-plugin`` — because
``docs/plugins.md`` publicly promises ``cao plugin list/info/enable/disable``
as a future surface for *event* plugins, and taking the noun retracts that
promise. This module is built and tested under the recommended verb as a
working placeholder. Per requirements.md 16.5, it must not ship to end users
until maintainers resolve M1; that gate blocks release, not construction, and
changing the verb is a one-line edit in ``cli/main.py`` plus this group's name.
