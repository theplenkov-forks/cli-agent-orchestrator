    This server provides tools to facilitate terminal delegation within CLI Agent Orchestrator sessions.

    ## Best Practices

    - Use specific agent profiles and providers
    - Provide clear and concise messages
    - Ensure you're running within a CAO terminal (CAO_TERMINAL_ID must be set)

        This tool allows handing off tasks to other agents by creating a new terminal
        in the same session. It sends the message, waits for completion, and captures the output.

        ## Usage

        Use this tool to hand off tasks to another agent and wait for the results.
        The tool will:
        1. Create a new terminal with the specified agent profile and provider
        2. Set the working directory for the terminal (defaults to supervisor's cwd)
        3. Send the message to the terminal
        4. Monitor until completion
        5. Return the agent's response
        6. Clean up the terminal with /exit

        ## Working Directory

        - By default, agents start in the supervisor's current working directory
        - You can specify a custom directory via working_directory parameter
        - Directory must exist and be accessible

        ## Model

        - By default, the agent uses whatever model its profile is configured with
        - You can pin a specific model via the model parameter, without needing a
          dedicated agent profile -- not honored by every provider

        ## Isolated worktrees (use_worktree)

        - Set use_worktree=true to give this handoff its own git worktree instead of
          sharing the supervisor's (or working_directory's) checkout -- closes the
          "parallel agents editing the same branch/files" race.
        - The worktree is created from the resolved directory's repo, on its own
          branch, and torn down when the handoff's terminal is torn down (success or
          failure): the checkout's working-tree contents are always discarded, but the
          branch is only deleted if it has no unmerged commits. Commit AND merge/push
          any results you need kept before the handoff completes -- an uncommitted or
          unmerged result is not preserved.
        - Requires the resolved working directory to actually be inside a git
          repository; otherwise the handoff fails with a clear error.

        ## Requirements

        - Must be called from within a CAO terminal (CAO_TERMINAL_ID environment variable)
        - Target session must exist and be accessible
        - If working_directory is provided, it must exist and be accessible

- The worktree is created on its own branch. When you call delete_terminal on the
  worker, the checkout's working-tree contents are always discarded, but the branch
  is only deleted if it has no unmerged commits -- commit AND merge/push results
  before deleting the worker if you need them kept.
- Requires the resolved working directory to be inside a git repository.

## Cleanup

When you are done with an assigned terminal (received results or no longer need it),
call delete_terminal(terminal_id) to free system resources.

    Two things the request needs beyond the id, both mirroring
    ``delete_terminal`` (PR #453 review, haofeif):

    - The internal ``Authorization`` header, for a LOCAL retrieval. The

      401 to a caller legitimately holding the job_id. A retrieval aimed at a
      ``target_host`` carries no bearer: ``CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`` is this node's
      credential, and sending it to another host would disclose it there.
    - ``target_host``. ``handoff(target_host=...)`` runs the step on that node
      and persists the row in ITS database, so the supervisor's own base URL has
      no such row.

        job_id: The job_id from the pending handoff result.

    server references have no native tool names, so CAO's own MCP surface is

    The authorization model here is the one CAO already has, not a second one.
    The effective list is the terminal's recorded ``allowed_tools``, or the

    you just wrote would make the approval gate decorative in exactly the case it was designed for.

    because script-tier steps are discovered by executing the Python and so have no run-level value at
    freeze time; they are covered transitively by the source hash.

    Approval enforcement is **off by default**. When it is off, an unapproved plan still runs, and
    ``approved: false`` here is informational rather than a prediction that the run will be refused.

    ``plan_id`` is ``null`` for a YAML run (which never freezes a manifest) and for a script run whose
