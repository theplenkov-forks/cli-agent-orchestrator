"""Terminal service with workflow functions.

This module provides high-level terminal management operations that orchestrate
multiple components (database, tmux, providers) to create a unified terminal
abstraction for CLI agents.

Key Responsibilities:
- Terminal lifecycle management (create, get, delete)
- Provider initialization and cleanup
- Tmux session/window management
- Terminal output capture and message extraction

Terminal Workflow:
1. create_terminal() → Creates tmux window, initializes provider, starts logging
2. send_input() → Sends user message to the agent via tmux
3. get_output() → Retrieves agent response from terminal history
4. delete_terminal() → Cleans up provider, database record, and logging

    into a 400 before any 409 arm could see it, and a later reorder could
    silently re-break it. As a plain ``Exception`` the only ordering
    requirement is that its arm precede the catch-all 500, which no reorder

    One synchronous, best-effort function: every step is guarded so a failure

    on a single worker thread through ``_await_uncancellable``, so neither the
    lifecycle lock (a ``threading.Lock`` a same-name teardown may be holding)
    nor a cancellation of the create request can leave it half done. The order
    is the one the steps depend on:

    1. FIFO reader and status monitor -- stop consuming the pane's output.
    2. Backend session or window -- locked and ownership-checked
       (``_roll_back_backend_create_if_still_ours``); the helper also drops the
       forwarded env for a session it kills. The window arm exists for
       harness-control#186: a window added to an ALREADY-EXISTING session
       (``new_session=False``, every MCP spawn/assign-into-existing-session
       call) has no session-level teardown to fall back on, and without it a
       provider init timeout rolled back the row and stopped the reader but
       left the pane running, invisible to list/tree, forever.
    3. Provider -- AFTER the process-owning session/window is stopped, because
       a provider releasing private on-disk state must not race a process
       still writing it (Grok's updater can still be writing ``$GROK_HOME``
       while its initialization fails; its cleanup verifies no such process
       remains).
    4. Registry row -- unless the provider deferred its cleanup (an explicit
       ``False`` from ``cleanup_provider``), in which case the row is the only
       retry handle and is retained so the failed terminal stays discoverable
       and its deletion retryable rather than leaking credentials/config.
       Idempotent (``DELETE ... WHERE id = ?``), a no-op when the failure
       happened before the row was written.
    5. Worktree -- a worktree created before a later step failed would
       otherwise survive as an orphan worktree + branch with no CAO-side
       record pointing at it.

    """Fingerprint the create-terminal request an idempotency key stands for.

    Review on PR #634, issue #616. Stored alongside the key so a later call
    presenting the same key can be told apart: same fingerprint is a RETRY
    (return the existing terminal), different fingerprint is a COLLISION
    (raise ``IdempotencyKeyConflict``).

    REQUESTED values, not resolved ones, and that is load-bearing. The key
    check runs before ``create_terminal`` resolves the working directory,
    provider fallback or Kiro engine, so resolved values do not exist yet;
    computing them in order to compare would perform the very work the key
    exists to skip. A genuine retry re-sends the same REQUEST, so
    requested-vs-requested is the comparison that matches, and fingerprinting
    resolved values would spuriously conflict a legitimate retry issued from
    a different process cwd (whose ``working_directory=None`` resolves
    differently) -- a false 409 on the exact case this feature serves.

    ``caller_id`` is one of the fields, which is what makes a CROSS-CALLER
    collision a mismatch rather than a silent hand-off of someone else's
    worker: two supervisors reusing ``job-1`` fingerprint differently and the
    second gets a loud 409. It is deliberately NOT additionally scoped in the
    primary key -- see the accepted residuals in ``create_terminal``'s
    docstring for the one case this cannot separate.

    ``env_vars`` and ``resume_session_id`` are hashed for the same reason, and
    ``env_vars`` has the sharpest precedent of any field here: ``RunStepRequest``
    refuses ``env_vars`` together with ``reuse_terminal_id`` outright, because
    "a silently dropped RUN_ID/GENERATION fence token is the quiet identity
    failure NFR-SEC-4 exists to prevent". Unhashed, this function reproduced
    exactly that -- a caller asking for one workflow run received a terminal
    launched with ANOTHER run's fence tokens, silently.

    ``allowed_tools`` AND ``engine`` ARE BOTH HASHED, and leaving either out
    was a live privilege-escalation hole rather than a matter of taste
    (review on PR #634). Both are persisted COLUMNS on
    the ``terminals`` table (``database.py:43,46``), i.e. launch-time terminal
    identity, and ``POST /sessions/{name}/terminals`` accepts either one in the
    SAME call as ``idempotency_key``. Unhashed, a second call reusing a key
    with a WIDER ``allowed_tools`` was handed the first call's narrow terminal
    -- and in the other order, a caller asking for a narrow tool set received a
    terminal holding ``execute_bash`` it never requested. ``allowed_tools`` is
    baked in at launch, not re-evaluated per message, so that wrong policy is
    PERMANENT for the terminal's life. Unhashed ``engine`` additionally let a
    key hit skip the Kiro engine validation the same request would otherwise
    have been rejected by (see ``create_terminal``'s docstring).

    This is also the contract two other reuse paths in this repo already hold
    us to: ``agent_step._validate_reused_terminal`` RAISES on an engine
    mismatch, and ``api/main.py`` rejects ``env_vars`` with
    ``reuse_terminal_id`` outright. ``step_fingerprint`` -- the other
    fingerprint in this codebase -- hashes ``allowed_tools`` sorted (BR-4) and
    says of ``engine`` that "it stays unconditionally hashed ... it is the
    single easiest thing to get wrong here."

    SERIALIZATION, following ``step_fingerprint``'s discipline:

    - ``allowed_tools`` members are SORTED but NOT de-duplicated, because
      ``["a","b"]`` and ``["b","a"]`` grant identical capability -- order
      sensitivity would manufacture a false conflict for a caller who merely
      reordered a comma list -- while ``["a","a"]`` differs from ``["a"]`` and
      collapsing it would hide a real difference.
    - EVERY component is LENGTH-PREFIXED by ``_fingerprint_component``, not
      merely separated. The values are caller-controlled, so a separator alone
      is forgeable; see that helper for the concrete collisions it prevents.
    - ``None`` and ``[]`` hash DIFFERENTLY (``_FP_TOOLS_UNSET`` versus
      ``_FP_TOOLS_SET``). They are genuinely different requests: ``None`` means
      "resolve the tool policy from the agent profile" while ``[]`` is an
      explicit empty set that is NOT resolved (see the ``allowed_tools is
      None`` branch below), so collapsing them would let one caller be served
      the other's privilege set. Note ``[]`` is NOT reachable over HTTP -- both
      endpoints parse ``allowed_tools.split(",") if allowed_tools else None``,
      so an empty query value arrives as ``None`` -- but it IS reachable from
      the in-process callers (session, flow and step services), which is why
      the distinction is kept rather than simplified away.
    - ``env_vars`` is a MAPPING, so it sorts by key (declaration order is not
      a difference) and length-prefixes key AND value, which no
      single-axis scheme would do. Unlike ``allowed_tools``, ``None`` and
      ``{}`` deliberately SHARE an encoding: every use in ``create_terminal``
      collapses them already (``env_vars or {}``, ``if env_vars:``), so they
      cannot yield materially different terminals. Same-shaped question as
      ``allowed_tools``, opposite verified answer -- which is why the resolver
      has to be read rather than the pattern matched.
    - ``engine`` normalises through ``KiroEngine.value`` because the parameter
      accepts the enum OR a plain string -- ``api/main.py`` forwards a query
      string while ``parse_kiro_engine`` returns the member, and the same
      logical request arriving by those two routes must produce ONE digest or
      a legitimate retry 409s.

    sha256 hexdigest rather than the joined text: the column stays a bounded
    64 chars regardless of path length, and filesystem paths and profile names
    are not left sitting in the database in cleartext. ``None`` normalises to
    ``""`` for the scalar fields, and the field ORDER is fixed by this function
    -- it is the only writer and the only reader, so the digest never has to be
    stable across versions, only within one.

        new_session: If True, creates a new tmux session. If False, adds to existing.
        working_directory: Optional working directory for the terminal shell
        env_vars: Operator-forwarded env vars (``cao launch --env``). On
            ``new_session=True``, these are stored on the session record and

            routing ids) must reach the window even inside an existing
            session. See issues #248 and #408.
        caller_id: Terminal ID of the supervisor that created this terminal
            via handoff/assign. Recorded so send_message can route callbacks
            structurally instead of parsing IDs out of message text (issue #284).
            None for operator-launched terminals.
        engine: Explicit Kiro engine. For Kiro, it must agree with the selected
            profile's engine when both are present; omitted resolves to v2.
        kiro_capability_probe: Optional test seam for the bounded wrapper probe.
        model: Explicit per-call model override, forwarded to the provider
            (where supported -- see each provider's own __init__) ahead of
            the agent profile's own static `model` field. Lets a caller
            (e.g. MCP handoff/assign's own `model` parameter) pin a specific
            model for one worker without needing a dedicated agent profile.
            None = behavior unchanged (profile.model, if any, still applies).

            worktree path before the tmux session/window is created. Requires
            the resolved directory to actually be inside a git repository.

        idempotency_key: Review on PR #634, issue #616. When given and a PRIOR
            call already created a terminal for the SAME KEY **and the same
            request**, that terminal is returned as-is and nothing else in
            this function runs -- no tmux window, no provider process, no new
            DB row. This is what makes a retry after a lost response safe:
            the caller that never saw the first response (e.g. a killed CLI
            process) can call again with the SAME key and land on the terminal
            the first, already-committed attempt produced, instead of creating
            a second worker. Persisted atomically with the terminal row (see
            ``database.create_terminal``); ``None`` (default) is the existing,
            unprotected behavior every current caller keeps.

            The key does NOT identify the request on its own -- it is matched
            together with a fingerprint of ELEVEN fields (see
            ``_request_fingerprint``). Presenting a key that a DIFFERENT
            request already claimed raises ``IdempotencyKeyConflict``
            (HTTP 409) rather than handing back a terminal that answers
            someone else's question. A key whose terminal no longer exists is
            treated as stale and simply creates fresh -- that is not a
            conflict.

            THE FIELD SET IS CLOSED BY ENUMERATION, not by however many review
            rounds happened to run. Every caller-reachable parameter of BOTH
            create endpoints -- ``POST /sessions`` (including everything
            ``CreateSessionBody`` and its ``CreateTerminalBody`` base carry)
            and ``POST /sessions/{name}/terminals`` -- is classified below,
            hashed or excluded-with-a-reason. Adding a parameter to either
            endpoint means classifying it here.

            HASHED (11) -- these determine what the terminal IS, or what
            privileges and context it launches with:
            ``provider``, ``agent_profile``, ``session_name``,
            ``working_directory``, ``caller_id``, ``model``, ``use_worktree``,
            ``engine``, ``allowed_tools``, ``env_vars``,
            ``resume_session_id``.

            EXCLUDED, each for a checked reason:

            - ``idempotency_key`` itself. It is the lookup key; hashing it
              would make every key match only itself.
            - ``group`` and ``metadata``. Discovery labels that are separately
              mutable AFTER creation via ``PATCH /terminals/{id}/group`` and
              the ``update_metadata`` MCP tool, so a create-time key is not
              their integrity boundary -- a caller who cares about their value
              cannot rely on creation to fix it anyway.
            - ``initial_message`` and ``initial_message_orchestration_type``.
              The delivered payload and its routing, not the terminal: neither
              is persisted on the row, and a genuine retry re-sends the same
              message. These create endpoints do not own the prompt.
            - ``defer_init``. Excluded, and this one was decided against the
              instinct that it looks like identity, because three things check
              out against the code:
              (a) On ``POST /sessions`` it is not caller-settable at all --
              ``session_service.create_session`` derives it as
              ``defer_init=initial_message is not None``. Hashing it would
              therefore make two otherwise-identical requests conflict purely
              because one supplied a message and the other did not, i.e. it
              would partially hash ``initial_message`` through the back door,
              contradicting the deliberate decision above not to hash the
              prompt.
              (b) It leaves NO permanent difference in the created terminal.
              The only row column it touches is ``shell_command``, which the
              deferred path sets to ``None`` up front and then writes after
              ``provider.initialize()`` returns, converging on the same value
              the synchronous path records immediately.
              (c) On a key HIT the returned status is read live by
              ``get_terminal``, not taken from this request, so ``defer_init``
              cannot change what a hit returns. And the short-circuit never
              waits for initialisation for ANY caller -- that is its purpose --
              so there is no wait guarantee here for a differing
              ``defer_init`` to violate. Hashing it would manufacture
              conflicts while buying no guarantee.
            - ``memory_manager``. Never reaches this function: the endpoint
              uses it to spawn a SEPARATE sidecar terminal with
              ``agent_profile="memory_manager"`` in a background task, so it
              cannot alter the identity of the terminal this key maps to.
              Excluded from the fingerprint, and no longer a duplication hole:
              the spawn is gated only on the flag's truthiness and this
              function still returns the same ``Terminal`` shape whether it
              created one or matched a key, so the endpoint cannot tell a reuse
              from a fresh create -- it therefore hands the sidecar its OWN key
              derived from the caller's (``<key>:memory-manager-sidecar``),
              making that create idempotent in its own right instead of relying
              on a signal it cannot get. A keyed retry now resolves to the
              first call's sidecar rather than spawning a second one.
            - ``new_session``. Not a caller parameter on either endpoint --
              each route passes its own fixed value -- so no caller can vary
              it under a shared key.
            - Framework and auth parameters (``request``,
              ``background_tasks``, ``_scopes``) and the ``body`` wrapper
              itself, which is expanded into its fields above.

            ``engine`` being in that set also closes a validation BYPASS
            (review on PR #634). The Kiro engine checks below run AFTER this
            short-circuit, so a key hit used to return 200 for an ``engine``
            the very same request would otherwise have been rejected with 400.
            A first call carrying an invalid engine raises before any terminal
            or key row is written, so a key hit implies the STORED engine was
            valid -- and any later differing engine now mismatches the
            fingerprint and is refused.

            ACCEPTED MISATTRIBUTION, recorded rather than left silent. Two
            cases, only one of which is this change's:

            - USED key + invalid engine: was 200 (the bypass above), now 409
              "this key was already used for a different request". So the
              operator is told to change their KEY when their ENGINE is what
              is wrong. Accepted rather than fixed, because reaching the real
              validator means loading the agent profile and running the Kiro
              capability probe -- a ``subprocess.run`` -- which is exactly the
              work this short-circuit exists to skip; paying it on every retry
              would trade away the property the feature is FOR in exchange for
              a better message. The request is refused either way; only the
              stated reason is imprecise.
            - FRESH key + invalid engine: 404 on
              ``POST /sessions/{name}/terminals`` (400 on ``POST /sessions``),
              because the validator raises a BARE ``ValueError`` -- not a
              ``KiroCapabilityError`` -- so it falls past that route's 400 arm
              to its generic "not found" arm. That is PRE-EXISTING, is
              unchanged by this change, and is deliberately not fixed here --
              correcting it means reworking error mapping this change does not
              own. Noted only so the 409 above is not mistaken for a
              regression from a 400 that never existed.

            This resolves an apparent tension with the commit directly beneath
            this one, which stopped ``engine`` being forwarded to a non-Kiro
            provider on the handoff reuse path. That change treats ``engine``
            as provider-SPECIFIC; this one treats it as part of request
            IDENTITY. Both hold: precisely because ``engine`` only means
            something for one provider, two requests differing in it are
            different requests, and the pair must not be conflated by a key.

            Two accepted residuals, recorded so they are not mistaken for
            bugs. Note neither is an exclusion from the field set above --
            those are enumerated there with their reasons; these are limits of
            what a fingerprint over those fields can distinguish:

            1. Two callers that BOTH have ``caller_id=None`` and are otherwise
               identical in all eleven fields are indistinguishable by
               fingerprint, so the second reuses the first's terminal. At that
               point the two requests are the same request by every property
               the server can observe, and reuse is the defensible answer.
               This is a REAL case rather than a hypothetical one, and
               specifically on the fresh-session path: ``caller_id`` is a
               caller parameter on ``POST /sessions/{name}/terminals`` ONLY --
               ``POST /sessions`` does not expose it -- so every keyed
               fresh-session create arrives with ``caller_id=None`` and this
               residual is the norm there, not the exception.
            2. The DELIVERED PROMPT is not hashed, so two same-shape requests
               carrying different messages reuse one terminal. This is
               deliberate and must not be "fixed" by adding the prompt -- a
               genuine retry re-sends the same prompt, and these create
               endpoints are not the prompt's owner.

            KNOWN DIVERGENCE, stated so the next reader need not rediscover
            it: even with eleven fields this remains a WEAKER contract than
            the other reuse path in this repo.
            ``agent_step._validate_reused_terminal`` RAISES on a provider or
            engine mismatch against the PERSISTED row, and ``RunStepRequest``
            rejects ``env_vars`` combined with ``reuse_terminal_id`` outright.
            Here a mismatch is refused only insofar as it changes one of the
            eleven hashed fields, and the comparison is
            request-against-request rather than
            request-against-persisted-metadata. The practical gap: a field
            that is excluded above, or a difference between the request and
            what the mapped terminal actually persisted, is not caught here.

        # request. Off-loop, only this worker thread waits.
        #
        # Why the section ends here: provider.initialize() below can take tens
        # of seconds, and a teardown of this name must never queue behind an

            Returns (window_name, session_created, window_created) -- the caller
            needs all three: create_window may rename the window, and the
            failure path keys its cleanup off which one this call created.

            A failure after the backend create RETURNS rolls that resource back
            HERE, still holding the lock, before re-raising: on return the tmux
            session/window and its registry row both exist, and on such a raise
            neither does. Without that the outer flags below would still be False
            (they are only assigned from a successful RETURN), the `except`
            cleanup would tear down nothing, and the failure would leave a live
            tmux session with no registry row -- the exact divergence #498 exists
            to eliminate. A "database is locked" OperationalError out of
            db_create_terminal is an ordinary outcome under CAO's concurrent
            writers, so this is a routine path, not a pathological one.

            NOT covered (pre-existing, and deliberately not claimed): a failure
            INSIDE the backend create itself, after it has already made the tmux
            resource but before it returns. `TmuxClient.create_session` lands the
            session at `server.new_session(...)` and only then reads
            `session.windows[0].name` -- a fresh list-windows fetch that can raise
            (IndexError, or its own `ValueError` when the name is None), with
            `create_window` shaped the same way. That leaks a session/window this
            closure never learns about, so the rollback below cannot fire. Same
            gap existed pre-#498, which set its flag only after the create
            returned. Closing it needs the guard to extend INTO the backend
            create; tracked separately.

            Why the rollback is INSIDE the lock rather than reported out to the
            outer cleanup path: the lock's entire purpose is that, for one
            session NAME, create and teardown are serialized so the name is
            never observable half-built. Rolling back after release would reopen
            that window -- between the release and the kill, another thread can
            acquire the name and legitimately succeed (a new_session=False
            create adding a window to what it sees as a live session, or a
            teardown plus a fresh new_session=True create rebuilding the name) --
            and the late kill would then destroy an incarnation this call does
            not own, leaving ITS row pointing at nothing. Under the lock the
            name goes free -> free with no observable intermediate state.

    One attempt of the confirm-and-redeliver loop shared by the deferred-init
    path (#479) and the synchronous step path (#562). First, when the provider
    opts in via ``supports_direct_status_probe``, a live capture-pane check
    catches a worker that IS already running but whose cached status lags
    behind (#496) — returns True (started) without sending anything. A caller
    that already holds the provider instance passes it; otherwise it is
    resolved from the registry, best-effort (a resolution failure means no
    probe, never a failed redelivery). Then the box check picks the
    redelivery: if the delivered text is still visible in the current composer
    only the Enter was swallowed (send a bare Enter); if it is absent the
    paste itself was dropped (re-deliver in full). See
    ``_message_visible_in_box`` for why guessing wrong must be avoided.

    ``full_resend_requires_probe`` gates the full re-send on the provider
    being probe-capable. Reason: the current-composer check cannot establish
    that a prompt which has already scrolled away was processed, and under the
    pyte screen path status detection runs only
    at rising-edge/quiescence — a whole turn can process inside one burst,
    leaving the cached status IDLE throughout while the prompt scrolls off —
    so for a provider without a direct status probe there is no way to
    distinguish "paste dropped" from "worker already ran" — and re-pasting
    the full message into a working worker silently runs the task twice.
    When the gate is on and the provider is not probe-capable, the
    bare-Enter branch (which cannot duplicate a task) is still taken
    whenever the text is visible; otherwise nothing is sent and False is
    returned, leaving the caller's own timeout to classify the outcome. The
    deferred-init path keeps the default (off) because it loops on
    ``wait_until_status`` for the PROCESSING edge before ever reaching here,
    and that pre-existing behavior is unchanged by this helper's extraction.

    The full re-send is forwarded to ``send_input`` as ``redelivery=True``: it
    repeats the dispatch CAO is already waiting on, so the provider must treat
    it as another delivery attempt of the same logical turn rather than as a
    newly dispatched turn.

    Returns True when the worker was found already started and nothing was
    sent; False when a redelivery was attempted (or deliberately skipped).

    ``state_buffer_max`` bytes (server setting, see settings_service.py; 32KB
    default); it falls back to a tmux history capture only when that buffer
    is empty. This is a deliberate trade-off in the

    retries extraction with 10 s delays between attempts.  This handles
    TUI-based providers (e.g. Antigravity CLI's renderer) whose notification
    spinners can temporarily obscure response text in the tmux capture buffer.

    If the provider exposes an ``extraction_tail_lines`` attribute, that
    fixed value is used for the history capture and the escalating-fetch

    This is a SEPARATE read path from ``get_output``: that function returns the
    bounded rolling buffer / tmux tail, whereas this reads an exact byte window
    from ``TERMINAL_LOG_DIR / f"{terminal_id}.log"`` — the append-only,
    monotonic file LogWriter maintains (BR-1). Playback (FR-4.3 / FR-7.3) uses
    the ``terminal_offset_start`` / ``terminal_offset_len`` an event carries to
    fetch exactly the output produced around that event, without copying the
    log into the journal (BR-3).

    Args:
        terminal_id: The terminal whose log to read. Validated against the
            workflow name/id charset before it is joined into the log path, so

            ``TERMINAL_LOG_DIR`` (path-traversal defense; reuses
            ``_validate_key_part``).
        offset: Byte offset to seek to. Must be ``>= 0``. An offset at or beyond
            EOF is not an error — the read simply returns the available tail
            (empty string when nothing follows the offset) so playback degrades
            gracefully (BR-4).
        length: Maximum number of bytes to read. Clamped to
            ``TERMINAL_RANGE_MAX_LENGTH`` (BR-2) to bound the read.

    Returns:
        The decoded slice, ``bytes.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")`` so a
        range that starts or ends mid-multibyte-sequence never raises (BR-5,
        matching LogWriter's write encoding). Returns ``""`` for a valid
        terminal whose log does not exist yet (nothing has been logged) — a
        missing log is NOT a playback-breaking error (BR-4).

    """Tear down a terminal's runtime state, but NOT its registry row.

    The destructive middle third: herdr inbox deregistration, pipe-pane stop,
    FIFO reader stop, status-monitor clear, the tmux window kill, worktree
    cleanup, provider cleanup, and the per-terminal bookkeeping registries. Every
    step is individually guarded and idempotent, so re-running it on an
    already-dismantled terminal is a no-op -- which is what makes a re-run after
    a failed session teardown safe.

    ``kill_window=False`` skips the two tmux-facing steps (pipe-pane stop and the
    window kill). Session teardown passes False because it has already confirmed
    the whole tmux SESSION gone, so the window no longer exists and both calls
    would only produce spurious warnings.

    For a retained deferred-init tombstone -- ``deferred_init_external_owner``,
    ``deferred_init_failure``, or ``deferred_init_runtime_reclaimed`` -- the two
    label-addressed tmux steps are REPLACED by ``cleanup_terminal_exact``, which
    keys on the terminal id instead. Session and window names are reusable, so a
    tombstone often shares them with a later, unrelated replacement; killing "the
    window called X" would destroy that replacement. ``kill_window=False`` makes
    the exact call identity-proof-only (no mutation), so a caller that already
    established the session is gone still gets a truthful verdict.

    Returns False when the runtime is NOT fully dismantled and the caller must
    keep the registry row for a durable retry. That covers a deferred provider
    cleanup (Grok's private-home owner could not yet be inspected/stopped), a
    FIFO reader that would not stop, and -- for tombstones -- an exact cleanup
    that answered anything other than DELETED or ABSENT (UNKNOWN and
    STILL_PRESENT both mean the runtime may still be live). Reporting True on a
    deferral would turn a temporary process race into a permanent leak, or
    record a still-live runtime as reclaimed.

    An unproven exact result also defers all remaining teardown: in particular,
    a retained failure can be rediscovered after restart while its original
    process still uses its worktree and private provider home. Retaining only
    the registry row cannot undo destruction of those live resources.

    Ordering note: stopping the FIFO reader before killing the window is
    preferred but not load-bearing -- since issue #382 the reader loop uses a
    non-blocking fd plus a ``select`` timeout and holds its own keepalive write
    end, so it can never park waiting on the pane and always observes the stop
    flag within one poll interval.
