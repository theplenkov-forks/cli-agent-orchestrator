## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Security groundwork for ephemeral agents (#801): installed profiles whose
  names match the reserved pattern can no longer be launched or listed;
  installed-profile APIs and CLI lookups refuse those names, and cao-server
  warns about them at startup. Terminal responses include a registry-derived
  `ephemeral` boolean. Ephemeral callers cannot delegate or start workflows
  unless the operator sets `ephemeral.child_may_delegate` to `true` in
  `settings.json`. Workflow `run`/`resume`/`start` now refuse when
  `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` is set but the calling terminal cannot be resolved.
  Ephemeral agent creation is not yet available.
- Advanced CodeQL analysis for same-repository and fork pull requests, with
  Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, GitHub Actions, and Rust coverage, plus `main`,
  weekly, and manual scans. CI workflow definitions and their `CODEOWNERS`
  policy are assigned to repository maintainers; the security guidance covers
  required owner review, stale-approval dismissal, merge gates, and the
  administrator-managed cutover (#857, #858).
- terminal records keep the model each terminal was launched with (`model`)
  and whether its provider applies a launch model (`model_honored`). Each
  provider declares the second through `honors_model`; the base default is
  `False`, so a provider that has not declared it is never reported as having
  run a model. Both columns are nullable and added by migration, and rows from
  before it read as unknown. Terminal and session responses,
  `cao session status`, and the ops MCP `get_terminal_status` and
  `get_session_info` return both fields; `list_siblings` and the delegation
  tool results are unchanged (#810)
- pane-mode windows caption each pane with the terminal running in it.
  `pane_window` gets `pane-border-status` and a border format reading the
  `@cao_terminal` mark, so the caption survives an agent whose TUI sets its own
  pane title. Set on that window only, and skipped for a window that carries a
  `pane-border-status` of its own, so an arrangement by hand is left alone. A
  tmux that refuses the options costs a warning rather than the spawn (#74)
- built-in `workflow_scout` role (`@builtin`, `fs_read`, `execute_bash`,
  `@cao-mcp-server`). The shipped scout profile previously resolved through
  the unknown-role fallback to unrestricted `["*"]`. It now resolves to this
  allowlist. `execute_bash` is still a full shell, so withholding `fs_write`
  and `web_fetch` is a category restriction, not a sandbox. (#746)
- `terminal.pane_layout` chooses how a pane-mode window is arranged after each
  spawn: `tiled` (default, unchanged behaviour), `even-vertical`,
  `even-horizontal`, or `none` to leave tmux's own splitting alone. The split
  direction follows the layout rather than being configured separately, because
  `select-layout` overrides the direction a pane was split in. Each layout holds
  a different number of agents before the window is full, and the terminal that
  does not fit still falls back to a window of its own (#74)
- `terminal.spawn_mode: "pane"` puts every terminal `assign` / `handoff` creates
  into one tmux window as a pane, re-tiled after each spawn, so a supervisor
  watches the whole fleet at once instead of cycling through a window per agent.
  The window is named by `terminal.pane_window` (default `cao-agents`) and the
  first pane terminal in a session creates it; when tmux has no room for another
  pane, that terminal falls back to a window of its own. Default is unchanged
  (`window`), and window mode addresses terminals exactly as before (#74, #73)
- **`CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN` now works on its own** (#706). Setting it with no IdP
  configured switches the auth layer on in a local-token mode: every scope-gated
  route, the PTY WebSocket handshake and the AG-UI stream must present exactly that
  value as a bearer, compared in constant time, and anything else is refused with
  401. Previously the variable was read only when an IdP was already configured, so
  on a default install it did nothing, while the environment-variable reference
  described it as a working local bearer token. Opt-in: with none of the three auth
  variables set, behavior is unchanged. The default-unauthenticated posture is now
  spelled out in `docs/configuration.md`, along with two consequences of turning
  the mode on: the `cao` CLI and the bundled Web UI send no bearer yet, and the
  token is inherited by every agent pane's environment.

- Profiles tab in the Web UI: browse, search, create (from template with live
  preview, or from scratch via a schema-driven form), edit, clone, and delete
  agent profiles over the profile management APIs, with validate-before-save
  surfacing bounded findings and the truncation-marker contract (#510)

### Fixed

- Mitigate the documentation toolchain's `braces` nesting-depth vulnerability
  with a local patch that preserves the published parser's behavior, and update
  `http-cache-semantics` to 4.3.0. Document the patch and disputed cache advisory,
  and run dependency regression checks as part of the existing site build
  without suppressing alerts or changing scan policy.
- Address five baseline CodeQL alerts without suppressions: remove filesystem
  probes from plugin source-kind inference, confine Kiro policy-file inspection
  to its canonical agent directory, replace the flagged Kimi footer and swarm
  status regex constructs, and check canonical schema-source metadata rather
  than a hostname substring in policy prose. Explicit local plugin paths,
  legacy Kiro filename mapping, and Kimi's content/chrome boundaries remain
  covered by regression cases.
- Run all four required CodeQL language jobs inside the main CI workflow,
  including full CI reruns, instead of relying on a separate PR trigger.
  Weekly and manual scans share the same maintainer-owned scan steps, with
  unchanged check names and fork permissions. Document how existing PR
  branches adopt the updated workflow (#857).
- refuse an install that would silently overwrite another profile's installed
  artifacts, instead of letting the second install clobber the first (#493).
  Two profile files can carry the same `name:`; the second used to replace the
  first's shared context copy — which the installed agent reads at runtime —
  and, for OpenCode, its agent file and `opencode.json` section. The check now
  runs for **every provider** and reads ownership from the context copy at its
  destination path rather than from profile discovery, so it holds when the
  installed copy is shadowed by a same-named file elsewhere, when its `name:`
  holds a `${VAR}` placeholder, when the directory is disabled, or when
  discovery fails. A profile that merely *could* produce the same id — a
  packaged built-in, or a local-store profile that has not been installed —
  does not block the install, since it owns no file yet; installing a profile
  whose `name:` matches one of the built-ins therefore still works, and the
  same profile still installs for any number of providers. The provider's own
  agent file (OpenCode `<id>.md`, Kiro `<name>.json`, Copilot `<name>.agent.md`)
  is probed as well, under that directory's case rules, so a context directory
  on case-sensitive storage can no longer let `Agent` silently replace an
  installed `agent` in a case-folding provider directory, and a provider file
  left behind by a hand-deleted context copy is refused rather than overwritten.
  That last rule holds for every provider's file, not only the one being
  installed for: while any provider's agent file for a name has no context
  record vouching for it, no install may create a new record for that name
  (which would otherwise let a later install for that provider replace the
  file on the strength of the new record). A provider directory whose listing
  cannot be read is refused as an I/O fault rather than treated as confirming
  the requested spelling. And an import — a local `.md` file or a URL — is
  written to the local store only after this check and the context writer's
  own checks (a symlink or directory at the context target, a provenance marker
  that does not read back, an unwritable context directory) accept it, so a
  refused import leaves the previously stored profile of that stem
  byte-identical; `--env` values are likewise persisted only after that point.
  Plugin install and uninstall, which replay `cao install` for every installed
  agent to re-materialise MCP servers, now enumerate the configured
  `agents.dirs.cao_installed` directory (and the default) instead of only the
  default, and replay each agent from the stem its provenance marker records
  rather than from its resolved name, so agents whose `name:` differs from
  their filename are refreshed instead of refused by the new check.

- the shared context copy is written to the configured installed-profile
  directory (`agents.dirs.cao_installed`), the directory profile discovery, the
  collision guard and the Copilot skill-injection probe read, instead of always
  the default path; a `~`, trailing-slash or symlinked spelling of the default
  still counts as the default, and with the default setting nothing moves. A
  blank or relative value under `agents.dirs` — for `cao_installed` or any
  other key — is ignored with a warning wherever CAO opens directories (profile
  discovery, the lookup behind `cao install <name>`, memory promotion's profile
  lookup, the context-copy writer),
  rather than making the server's working directory a profile source or the
  write root; the Settings API still reports the value as saved. With an
  override configured, the guard and the probe also consult the default
  directory, so ownership records written there by earlier releases stay in
  force (#493).

- **Workflow script run-step refusals now retain their typed reason in run
  records.** When a structured HTTP error includes a string `detail.kind`,
  `ShimHTTPError` includes that kind and its optional message in the exception
  text, so replay divergence, decision-required halts, worker errors, and
  timeouts remain distinguishable after an uncaught exception reaches the
  script's stderr tail. Unstructured responses keep the previous message.
  (#830)
- **Kiro CLI 2.25.0 turns never reached COMPLETED.** 2.25 prints the
  completion marker as `▸ Credits: turn 0.20 • session 0.20 | Time: 29s`; the
  detector wanted a number straight after `Credits:`, so every finished turn
  fell through to the separator fallback, which the new "Trust All Tools
  active" band defeats as well. A terminal reported PROCESSING for the whole
  task and then IDLE forever while the pane showed the finished response, so a
  supervisor never saw its worker complete and the Kiro e2e cases timed out.
  The marker now accepts a word between `Credits:` and the number; fixtures cut
  from live 2.25.0 frames pin idle, working and finished. The 2.25 reply
  extractor also anchors extraction to the turn's Credits lines and starts at
  the bullet-prefixed assistant row, so the startup banner, echoed prompt and
  `Trust All Tools` footer are no longer returned as the answer (#832, #837)

- **The `cao` CLI and the bundled Web UI can now talk to an auth-enabled
  server.** Neither presented a bearer, so with an IdP or a standalone
  `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN` configured every `cao launch`/`session`/`terminal`/
  `workflow`/`info`/`shutdown` call and every Web UI request got a bare `401`.
  The CLI's HTTP calls (36 sites across the six commands and the polling
  helpers in `utils/terminal`) now go through `utils/api_http`, which attaches
  `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN` from the CLI's environment to requests aimed at this
  node's API and to nothing else, and turns a `401` with no token configured
  into an error naming the variable. The Web UI takes a token from the URL
  fragment (`/#token=…`, moved into `sessionStorage` and stripped from the
  address bar before anything renders) or from a new **Server Access Token**
  field in Settings, and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer` on every request,
  `?token=` on the terminal WebSocket and `?access_token=` on the workflow event
  stream. With no token set every client sends exactly what it did before
  (#838, closes #807)

- **OpenCode agents whose display name contains spaces never reported COMPLETED.**
  The completion marker read the agent name as one `\S+` token, so a marker such
  as `▣  Sisyphus - Ultraworker · Big Pickle · 3.1s` never matched and every
  handoff to that agent ran out its timeout. The name now runs to the first `·`
  on the same line. It stops at a newline so that a reply line starting with `▣`
  cannot begin a match and cut the lines before it out of the extracted reply
  (#806, #816)

- **a custom role in `settings.json` now outranks the built-in role of the same
  name.** The resolver consulted the built-ins first, so when CAO shipped a
  built-in `workflow_scout` an operator's saved `workflow_scout` policy was
  silently replaced by the built-in's list: resolution and delegated child policy
  gained `execute_bash` and lost the listing or web-fetch tools the saved policy
  granted, while `settings.json` read back unchanged. Settings roles are now
  consulted first for every name, so a saved `supervisor`, `developer` or
  `reviewer` also takes effect where it was previously ignored. A settings role
  that shadows a built-in is logged by name (never its contents). (#746)
- **a PTY WebSocket handshake with no peer address skipped the client-IP allowlist.**
  `/terminals/{id}/ws` checked `client_host not in WS_ALLOWED_CLIENTS` only when a
  peer address was present, so a `None` peer passed instead of failing closed. Not
  reachable on a default install: the pinned uvicorn populates the peer for every
  TCP connection and its proxy-headers middleware never rewrites it to `None`, so
  this guards against other ASGI servers or middleware that leave the peer unset.
  An unattributable peer is now refused with 4003 unless the explicit `*` opt-out
  is set.

- **The terminal WebSocket's `?token=` query parameter reached uvicorn's logs
  in clear.** Two gaps: the redaction filter only knew `access_token` and
  `ticket`, and it was attached only to `uvicorn.access`, while uvicorn writes
  the WebSocket handshake line (`"WebSocket /terminals/<id>/ws?token=…"
  [accepted]`, and the `403` variant) on `uvicorn.error`, which a filter on a
  sibling logger never sees. With authentication enabled every web-viewer
  attach therefore wrote the `cao:write`-scoped JWT to stderr. `token` is now
  redacted and the filter is attached to both loggers. The filter also decodes
  percent-encoded parameter names before deciding: the server accepts
  `?%61ccess_token=<JWT>` exactly like `?access_token=`, and uvicorn logs the
  raw bytes.
- **Six read routes lacked the `cao:read` gate their siblings carry:**
  `GET /agents/profiles/search`, `GET /agents/providers` (which provider
  binaries exist on the host), `GET /sessions/{name}/terminals`,
  `GET /terminals/{id}/working-directory`, `GET /settings/skill-dirs` and
  `GET /settings/memory`. With authentication enabled they answered without a
  token. No change with authentication off (the default). The read-gating
  structural test now covers them; the only GETs left open are `/health`, the
  OAuth discovery document, the static profile schema/template metadata and the
  AG-UI stream, which carries its own credential.

- **`@builtin` in an `allowedTools` list enabled `bash`, `edit` and `write` on
  OpenCode.** The OpenCode permission translator expanded the selector into the
  four standard categories, while `utils/tool_mapping.py` treats every
  `@`-prefixed entry as a non-grant for the providers it translates. The shipped
  `reviewer` role lists `@builtin`, so an OpenCode reviewer was not read-only.
  The selector now grants nothing on OpenCode either; run `cao install` again
  for existing OpenCode agents, since the `permission:` block is written at
  install time. A profile whose `allowedTools` listed **only** `@builtin`
  previously got `read`/`grep`/`glob` (and the write and bash tools) on
  OpenCode and now gets none of them: add `fs_read`, `fs_list` and the rest
  explicitly, as the shipped roles already do (#824)

- **Codex startup handling could stall a launch, or press keys into the wrong
  dialog.** `startup_prompt_handler_timeout` is now the idle gap between
  startup prompts, with `provider_init_timeout` as the hard cap, so lowering
  the gap for another provider no longer truncates Codex's handler; the
  first-run sign-in menu is recognised as a settled state instead of running
  the handler to its cap; the handler now decides once per frame which startup
  block is actually live at the bottom of the pane and sends a key only to
  that block, so stale trust text left in scrollback can no longer answer a
  live update dialog or sign-in menu; a frame in which a further dialog is
  still being drawn is held rather than keyed, whether or not a complete
  dialog is on screen above it; the idle gap is judged on a freshly read frame
  with no dialog on it, not on the clock alone; the idle composer takes part in
  that same positional decision and status detection uses the same resolver, so
  trust wording a dismissed dialog leaves above the live composer no longer
  reports `WAITING_USER_ANSWER` and a modal arriving below a stale composer no
  longer reads as ready; initialisation fails, instead of succeeding through
  the login menu's `WAITING_USER_ANSWER` path, when a trust or update dialog is
  still on screen at the handler's cap or after the readiness wait; a
  profile's own `provider_init_timeout` now governs every Codex initialisation
  wait; the resolver's mid-redraw ("transitional") reading is honoured only
  until initialisation is over, so assistant prose quoting a startup phrase
  mid-turn no longer flips a processing terminal to `WAITING_USER_ANSWER` on
  the runtime status path; and the post-readiness check re-reads a mid-redraw
  frame a few times instead of failing an otherwise-valid login start on a
  single capture (#731)

- **enabling `CAO_MEMORY_API_URL` rejected memory keys that work without it.**
  The `/internal/memory/store` and `/forget` routes validated the wire `key` as
  the strict `MemoryKey` (`^[a-z0-9-]{1,60}$`), while the MCP tools have always
  let `MemoryService._sanitize_key` normalise it — so `memory_store(key="Prefer
  Pytest")` stored `preferpytest` in-process and 422'd through the gateway.

- **an unreadable `settings.json` reported itself as "self-learning is
  disabled".** `settings_service._load()` gated on `Path.exists()`, which returns
  False on a `PermissionError` from the parent directory — silently, with no log
  line — and swallowed every other read error, so a filesystem fault resolved to
  a configuration message. Learning still fails closed, but `/outcomes` now
  answers 503 when the file cannot be read, `GET /settings/memory` reports
  `settings_readable`, and the tools surface it as a plain `error` rather than a
  `disabled` payload that `skills/cao-learning` instructs agents to skip silently.

- **`report_outcome` and `list_outcomes` opened SQLite in the agent's own
  process**, so they failed for any agent that does not share a filesystem with
  cao-server — and unlike the memory tools they have no `CAO_MEMORY_API_URL` path,
  so configuration could not work around it. Both now call the existing
  `POST`/`GET /outcomes` routes.

- **the MCP server's terminal lookup did not carry the internal bearer token.**
  `GET /terminals/{id}` is scope-gated, so with auth enabled it 401'd, the
  terminal context resolved to `None`, and memory scope silently collapsed to
  global. A transport or auth failure now propagates instead of being reported as
  a missing terminal identity.

- **built-in memory plugins created the server's database directory inside every
  agent process.** They are discovered through `cao.plugins` entry points and that
  discovery runs at MCP-server import, so their module-level `clients.database`
  import executed its import-time `DB_DIR.mkdir()` in agents — and failed outright
  wherever the data dir is unreadable. The import is now lazy.

- **Grok's launch line inlined the whole `--rules` text ahead of the
  permission flags.** A profile plus skill catalog of several KB pushed the
  line past the tty's 4096-byte limit. The cut landed inside the quoted text,
  so the shell hung on an unclosed quote and Grok never started (an init
  timeout, not an unrestricted run), but the `--permission-mode`/`--allow`/
  `--deny` flags were the part of the line behind the text. The rules now live
  in a 0600 `rules.md` inside the terminal's private `GROK_HOME`, referenced
  from the line with `"$(cat …)"` (as the Codex provider already does for its
  instructions), the line no longer grows with the profile, and the permission
  flags precede it (#824)

- **The launch confirmation showed a Blocked list on providers that cannot
  enforce one.** `cao launch` printed `Allowed:`/`Blocked:` for every provider
  and `--auto-approve` said restrictions were "still enforced", while Hermes
  (`--yolo --accept-hooks`) and Cursor CLI (`--force`) apply no restriction at
  all and were missing from the server's soft-enforcement set, so a restricted
  supervisor on them ran unrestricted with nothing telling the operator. One
  table (`utils/enforcement.py`) now classifies every provider as native,
  prompt-only or none; the confirmation prints an `Enforcement:` line and a
  warning on prompt-only and none providers, the empty deny list on untranslated
  providers no longer reads as `(none)`, the server warning covers Hermes and
  Cursor, and a test keeps the SECURITY.md and docs tables equal to the code
  (SECURITY.md gains the seven missing rows, the docs table gains OMP). Kiro
  CLI, the default provider, moves from "Hard" to "None": it is launched with
  `--trust-all-tools` on every profile, and the `allowedTools` CAO writes into
  the agent JSON only suppresses approval prompts in Kiro; `tools` decides
  availability and is `["*"]` unless the profile sets it. Applying the CAO
  policy to Kiro at launch, and refusing restricted roles on providers that
  cannot enforce them, are separate decisions. OpenCode is the one native provider whose policy is the INSTALLED agent's: the gate now says `native at install time` and that launch overrides do not change it, instead of `Blocked: (none)` beside a native promise; the third copy of the "providers with native tool denial" list (docs/cursor-cli.md) and the prompt-only provider prose in docs/tool-restrictions.md now agree with the table, and the Kiro e2e case that asserted blocking now asserts the opposite directly (a restricted Kiro supervisor can run bash), so an environmental failure cannot pass as the expected result; on the author's machine the case has not yet produced a result (kiro-cli 2.24.1 timed out waiting for its agent prompt), so the classification rests on the launch flags and Kiro's documentation, not on an observed run (#824)
- **The local API bearer was sent to other nodes.** `handoff`/`assign` with a
  `target_host`, `delete_terminal` with a `target_host`, `get_handoff_result`
  with a `target_host`, and a remote worker's `send_message` back to its
  supervisor's `CAO_CALLBACK_URL` all attached
  `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN` to requests aimed at another host. The token now goes
  only to this node's own `API_BASE_URL`; cross-node requests carry no
  `Authorization` header (the elastic worker gateway headers are unaffected).
  No change when authentication is off. Behaviour change when it is on: a
  multi-node deployment that gave every node the same `CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`
  was authenticating these cross-node calls by accident, and they now fail
  with 401 on the remote node; the token is documented as this node's
  loopback credential only (#822)

- **Both MCP servers now pin `transport="stdio"`.** FastMCP otherwise honours
  `FASTMCP_TRANSPORT` from the environment, and an `http` value would have
  turned a stdio tool into a loopback listener with no MCP-level auth in front
  of its API hop (#822)
- **The credential gate on federated memory writes and `--redact` exports
  missed common key formats.** It now recognises Anthropic and OpenAI API
  keys, GitHub fine-grained and OAuth/app tokens, Slack tokens, JSON Web
  Tokens, Slack bot/user/app-level (`xapp-`) tokens and AWS secret access
  keys (next to an `aws ... secret`/`access` context word or a
  `SecretAccessKey` key), and it no longer lets an invisible character inside
  a prefix hide a credential: the whole Unicode format category (zero-width
  characters, bidi marks, soft hyphen, invisible operators; frozen at Unicode
  16.0 so Python 3.10 and 3.11, whose own tables are older, catch the same
  code points) plus the variation selectors, not a short list. Parsed
  documents keep their key
  context: the execution manifest and step output redact a 40-character value
  under a `SecretAccessKey`-style key, a value whose key makes the pair read
  as a credential assignment (`{"password": …}`, `{"api_key": …}`), and the
  `value` of a `{name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, value: …}` entry, none of which
  the text pattern can see once key and value are scanned apart. The graph export gate
  scans the parsed view (`scan_json_for_secrets`) rather than its
  `json.dumps` form, whose default `ensure_ascii` had turned a hidden
  character into a `\u` escape before the gate could strip it.
  Vendor patterns are matched before the generic `bearer`/`secret` ones, so
  the reported pattern name is the specific one (#821)

- **Atomic file writes read the process umask by setting it to 0.** The
  writer behind profile and archive updates (`utils/atomic_file`) and the
  vault writer behind federated memory notes (`services/vault/writer`) both
  derived a new file's mode with `os.umask(0)` followed by a restore. The
  umask is process-wide and cao-server is threaded, so a file created with
  the default mode by any other thread inside that window could be born
  world-writable. A new file's temp is now created with `O_EXCL` and mode
  0666 so the kernel applies the umask itself; an existing file's mode is
  preserved as before, and the umask is never touched (#821)

- **The blocked-path list for working directories and archive targets was
  exact-match only.** `/etc/passwd` passed with `allow_file`, and an existing
  directory such as `/etc/ssl` was a valid working directory. System
  configuration, kernel and device pseudo-filesystems, boot files, the
  system binary and library directories and the crontab spool (`/etc`,
  `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/boot`, `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`,
  `/lib`, `/lib64`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/lib64`, `/root`, `/var/spool/cron`, and
  `/private/etc` on macOS; the `/usr/lib*` entries are what makes the `/lib`
  rule hold on usr-merged Linux, where `/lib` resolves to `/usr/lib`) are now refused at any
  depth, with `/dev/shm` carved out. `/tmp`, `/var`, `/home`-style roots stay
  exact-only because projects legitimately live beneath them; a cao-server
  that runs as root must keep its projects outside `/root` (#821)
- **CI referenced GitHub Actions by mutable tag**, including in the jobs that
  hold `RELEASE_DEPLOY_KEY`, `CODECOV_TOKEN` and the Pages OIDC token; five
  steps ran `npm install` rather than `npm ci` against committed lockfiles, and
  no `uv` command was held to the committed lock: a PR that changed
  `pyproject.toml` without updating `uv.lock` had `uv run` re-resolve and
  install the new dependencies. All 66 tag references across `ci.yml`,
  `release.yml`, `gh-pages.yml`, `secret-scan.yml` and the four provider test
  workflows are pinned to the commit each tag resolved to (tag kept as a
  comment), `npm ci` is used throughout, every workflow that runs `uv` sets
  `UV_LOCKED=1` so `uv sync`, `uv run` (including inside `make`) and
  `uv export` fail on a stale lock instead of re-resolving, and the `uv sync`
  and `uv export` commands spell `--locked` as well (`publish-to-pypi.yml`
  gains the same). `.github/dependabot.yml` now exists so the SHA pins move;
  a test asserts every `uses:` is a full SHA and every uv workflow carries the
  lock policy. `cargo-deny.yml`'s actions were already pinned (#820)

- **Forwarded session environment accepted loader, shell and interpreter
  startup variables.** `--env`, the ops-MCP `launch_session` tool and
  `POST /sessions` now refuse `LD_*`, `DYLD_*`, `GCONV_PATH`, `PATH`, `HOME`,
  `SHELL`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `ZDOTDIR`, `PROMPT_COMMAND`, `PS0`, `PS1`, `PS2`,
  `PS4`, `PYTHONSTARTUP`, `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME`, `PERL5OPT`, `PERL5LIB`,
  `NODE_OPTIONS`, `RUBYOPT` and `RUBYLIB`, whose value decides what runs as the
  operator the moment the pane starts, plus their siblings `PYTHONUSERBASE`,
  `PERLLIB` and `NODE_PATH`, and `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` / `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`,
  which the AWS SDK reads when the provider CLI authenticates at startup and
  whose `credential_process` runs the command the file names. `POST /sessions` also applies the existing forwarded-env rules at
  the HTTP boundary (422 naming the key) instead of dropping violating keys
  server-side with only a log warning (#823)

- **The per-terminal output FIFO accepted whatever sat at its path.** The
  reader checked `exists()` then called `mkfifo`, and opened the path following
  symlinks, so a same-user process that planted a symlink or regular file at
  the predictable `<CAO_HOME_DIR>/fifos/<terminal>.fifo` (by default under
  `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator`) could redirect the output stream. The FIFO is now created exclusively with mode 0600, an existing
  non-FIFO at the path fails terminal creation instead of being used, and both
  opens use `O_NOFOLLOW` and verify the descriptor is a FIFO. The write end
  had the same gap from the other side: `pipe-pane -o "cat >> <path>"` follows
  a symlink and appends to a regular file, so a swapped path received the
  pane's output while the hardened reader stayed on the old pipe. tmux now
  runs `utils/fifo_writer.py` (standard library only, started by file path with `-I -S`)
  instead of `cat`, which opens with `O_NOFOLLOW`, checks the descriptor is a
  FIFO, and only then copies the pane's output into it (#823)

- **Session teardown could reach tmux sessions CAO did not create.** CAO
  shares the operator's default tmux server and names every session it creates
  `cao-<name>`, but `DELETE /sessions/{name}` (and so `cao shutdown --session`
  and the ops `shutdown_session` tool) passed any valid name straight to the
  kill, so a request for `dev` destroyed a personal session called `dev`. A
  bare name is now canonicalised to `cao-<name>` on the route, the same rule
  `POST /sessions` applies, and `session_service.delete_session`,
  `TmuxClient.kill_session` and `TmuxClient.kill_window` refuse any name
  without the prefix. Behaviour change: a shutdown request for an unprefixed
  name now targets the CAO session of that name and can no longer remove a
  personal one. A dedicated tmux socket is tracked separately (#823)

- **A failed herdr command put its raw stderr into the error returned to API
  clients.** herdr's stderr can name local paths, socket locations and flags.
  The exception now carries the redacted command and exit status only; stderr
  goes to the cao-server log (#823)

- **A failed terminal create could kill a newer session of the same name.**
  When provider initialisation failed after the session and its registry row
  were committed, the rollback killed the tmux session by name without the
  lifecycle lock, so a teardown and recreate of that name landing in between
  lost the new session. The rollback now reacquires the lock and proceeds only
  if this create's own registry row still names the session; otherwise the
  name belongs to someone else and the backend session is left alone. The
  same check now guards the compensator for a create whose caller was
  cancelled after the row committed, which killed by name too. Both rollbacks
  run off the event loop: they block on the lifecycle lock, and a same-name
  teardown holding it would otherwise have stalled every API request until it
  finished. The failure handler's whole cleanup (reader, status buffer, backend
  session or window, provider, registry row, worktree) is now one operation
  that a cancellation of the create request cannot interrupt: a cancel landing
  while the rollback waited for the lock used to unwind the handler after the
  backend kill but before the provider and row were removed, leaving a
  registered provider and a row for a terminal that no longer existed; the
  cancellation is still raised to the caller, once the cleanup is durable. The
  cleanup thread is driven by an executor future rather than a task, so a
  whole-server shutdown that lands while the rollback waits for the lock
  cancels only the waiting request and returns once the thread finishes,
  instead of spinning on a cancelled task and never exiting (#823)

### Changed

- record the originating install handle in each shared context copy's frontmatter
  (`x-cao-source-stem`), so a reinstall can tell its own prior copy apart from a
  different profile that resolves to the same OpenCode agent id. The key is
  CAO-written: a source profile that declares it at the top level of its
  frontmatter has that line replaced by CAO's own at install, and the install is
  refused when the result does not read back as the marker CAO wrote. Only the
  top-level entry is touched — a literal scalar whose text mentions the key, or
  a nested mapping key spelled the same way, is left as written — and
  frontmatter written as a single flow mapping (`{name: x, ...}`) receives the
  marker as an entry inside the braces, so valid flow-style profiles install
  (#493).

- write the shared context copy atomically, via a same-directory temporary file
  and `os.replace`, so an interrupted install cannot leave a truncated copy; a new
  copy is created `0o600` regardless of umask, and a reinstall preserves the
  existing file's mode (#493).

- `list_outcomes` clamps `limit` to 200 client-side; the service already clamped
  silently, so `limit=500` keeps working rather than becoming a 422.

### Security

- **Kiro CLI, the default provider, now applies the CAO tool policy.** `cao
  install --provider kiro_cli` writes the resolved `allowedTools` into the agent
  JSON's `tools` field, which is what Kiro lets the agent *have* (`allowedTools`
  only names what runs without a prompt, and CAO launches `--trust-all-tools`),
  so a restricted role has no shell, write or network tool to call: on kiro-cli
  2.25.0 a `code_supervisor` gets `read`/`glob`/`grep`/`knowledge` plus
  `@cao-mcp-server`, and `@builtin` becomes the harmless chrome
  (`goal`/`introspect`/`todo_list`) rather than every built-in, shell included,
  which is what a bare `@builtin` means in Kiro. `subagent` and `use_aws` gate
  with `execute_bash`, `code` (it can rewrite files) with `fs_write`,
  `knowledge` with `fs_read`. Both the current names and the older
  `fs_read`/`fs_write`/`execute_bash` aliases are written so 2.22 and 2.25
  read the same grant; an unrestricted policy still writes `["*"]` and an
  explicit profile `tools` list still wins. Kiro moves from **None** to
  **Hard (install time)** in SECURITY.md and docs/tool-restrictions.md, next to
  OpenCode: the policy is the installed agent's, and `--allowed-tools` or a
  role override at launch does not change it. **Reinstall your Kiro profiles**:
  one installed before this change still carries `tools: ["*"]`; `cao launch`
  and the server warn when they find one and keep treating that terminal as
  unrestricted. The Kiro e2e restricted case asserts bash is refused again
  (#836, follow-up to #824)

- **Agent plugin git sources are allowlisted by scheme and host.** The plugin
  resolver handed the source string to `git clone` unchanged, and for git the
  text before `://` is a transport: `file://` read any repository the server
  user could, `git://` opened a TCP connection from the server to any host and
  port it could reach, and the `ext::` helper runs a command wherever git's
  protocol policy allows it; `--` on the argv guards against option injection
  only. The surface is default-off (`CAO_AGENT_PLUGINS_ENABLED`) and, with auth
  on, needs `cao:write`, but with auth off any local caller of `POST /plugins`
  could reach it, and `"kind": "git"` skipped the CLI's shape check. A plugin is
  now cloned only over `https://` or `ssh://` (URL or scp-style) from an allowed
  host (`github.com` by default; `CAO_PLUGIN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` replaces the list),
  with no query, fragment or embedded credential, the clone target is rebuilt
  from the validated parts, and every `git` CAO runs is pinned with
  `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=https:ssh` and `http.followRedirects=false` so the rule
  holds inside git as well. Same posture as the profile downloader's
  `CAO_PROFILE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` guard. Reported by Chowdhury Faizal Ahammed
  through the AWS Vulnerability Reporting Program; thank you. (#847)

- **an unknown `role` no longer falls open to unrestricted `["*"]`.** Omitting
  `role` still uses developer defaults. A typo or a role that is not defined
  now raises `ValueError` on install, launch, and delegation, so providers no
  longer skip native deny flags. **Breaking:** profiles that previously
  launched because an undefined role fell open to `["*"]` now fail closed.
  Define the role under `agents.roles` (or the legacy flat `roles` key), or
  omit `role` for developer defaults. An explicit `allowedTools` list still
  wins and does not raise. (#746)


## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- MiniMax Code (`mcode`) provider with per-terminal authentication and profile
  isolation, model and MCP configuration, multi-turn TUI orchestration,
  supervisor/worker E2E coverage, and provider documentation (#624)
- Oh My Pi (`omp`) provider with additive native configuration, profile MCP extension wiring, lifecycle detection, and supervisor/worker orchestration support (#559)
- Add the official xAI Grok Build CLI as the `grok_cli` provider, including
  isolated per-terminal MCP configuration, native hard tool restrictions,
  multi-turn TUI support, orchestration e2e coverage, and provider docs.
- async run submit, discovery, and live event following (#505) (#525)

- rewrite the cao tui front door in Rust (#547)

- Add `cao agent assign|handoff|send-message|status|result|cancel` CLI
  commands as a fallback for in-session MCP orchestration when a terminal's
  `cao-mcp-server` connection is unavailable. Same behavior as the
  `assign`/`handoff`/`send_message`/`delete_terminal` MCP tools, backed by a
  shared `utils/orchestration` implementation module so neither entry point
  can drift from the other (#616)


### Changed

- drop the _origin_authority wrapper, document when the scheme guard applies (#669)


### Documentation

- stop the documented unit-test command from selecting e2e tests (#679)

- add a contributor blog to the documentation site (#685)


### Fixed

- `list_sessions` no longer issues one terminal query per tmux session, and both terminal reads now state their oldest-first order instead of inheriting it. The per-session `list_terminals_by_session` call inside ownership enrichment cost a query per session on a path that `GET /sessions` and the fleet snapshot both poll; it is now a single read bounded to the live sessions, so the cost scales with the sessions being listed rather than with the whole terminals table (rows for sessions tmux no longer reports accumulate, because `cleanup_service.cleanup_old_data` only runs at server startup). The ordering half matters because **a session's first terminal is normally its conductor** (index 0 is its oldest surviving row; if the conductor's own terminal is deleted, the oldest remaining worker takes that slot) and five consumers depend on it: `list_sessions` reports the earliest terminal carrying an `agent_profile` or `working_directory` as the session's owner (#497), `cao session status` and `cao session list` label it the Conductor over HTTP, flow recycling decides whether to kill a session by whether it is busy, and the fleet-panel example sends messages to it. That order was previously implicit in SQLite's row layout, so adding an index — the obvious reaction to a slow per-session lookup — could have silently changed which terminal a session advertised as its owner, and ordering by the terminal `id` (a `uuid4` prefix) would have made it a random one outright. Both reads now order by insertion, which is creation order. Swallowed-exception logs on this path also keep their tracebacks, so a database or pane failure is diagnosable from the log instead of only by reproducing it (#629)

- kiro_cli no longer passes `--legacy-ui`, which silently disabled every MCP tool. The flag is mutually exclusive with the `--agent-engine=v2` CAO pins (kiro-cli exits with `Conflicting options: --legacy-ui cannot be used with --agent-engine=v2`), and on its own it implicitly selects the **v1 agent engine, which exposes no MCP tools to the model**. Since CAO's whole orchestration surface (`assign`, `handoff`, `report_outcome`, `list_outcomes`, `store_lesson`) is delivered over MCP, affected agents started cleanly — the MCP server still booted and logged `✓ cao-mcp-server loaded` — and then reported "no such tool" for everything CAO gave them. Observed as a silent 7-day self-learning outage before the flag combination began erroring outright. The startup consent dialog `--legacy-ui` used to suppress is auto-answered after launch instead (#557), so nothing is lost by dropping it. Also removes the `--legacy-ui` retry on startup timeout: a "successful" retry would land on the MCP-less engine, turning a loud timeout into an agent that looks healthy and cannot orchestrate, so initialization now raises. `--legacy-ui` is correspondingly no longer a probed wrapper capability, which additionally unblocks wrappers that do not advertise it
- tmux listing parse failures are retried once and reported as a distinct condition instead of surfacing as a bare `ValueError` that reads like "session not found" one layer up. libtmux 0.53.1+ zips `parse_output`'s fields with `strict=True`, so any short row (a pane or session vanishing mid-listing, or trailing fields tmux omits) raised `ValueError: zip() argument 2 is shorter than argument 1` — which propagated through `server.sessions`/`window.panes`, blocked launches outright, and left the pipe-liveness watchdog unable to tell a genuinely-gone session from a transient parse failure. Adds `TmuxLookupError` and routes the listing reads in `clients/tmux.py` through a single retry-and-classify wrapper; a failed `create_session` no longer leaves an orphaned tmux session that blocks relaunching the same name. Also caps `libtmux<0.53.1`, the last release that zips non-strict (caom-anv)
- Codex handoff extraction now skips native TUI activity cells without relying on an English verb allowlist, including when the model's reply starts with prose (#545)
- `list_sessions` ownership metadata now persists the effective canonical launch directory, stays stable after pane `cd`, and purges stale terminal rows before same-name session relaunches so reused sessions report the new directory/profile (#497)
- make session teardown atomic so tmux and the terminal registry can no longer diverge (#498). `delete_session` previously trusted a pre-loop liveness reading and an unverified `kill_session` result, so a session could survive while its registry rows were deleted (orphaned tmux session) or vice versa (ghost rows that later misattributed a reused session name). Now: session creation and session teardown are mutually exclusive per session *name* (a concurrent launch can no longer interleave with a teardown of the same name), `kill_session` returns True only once the session is confirmed gone, and registry rows are deleted only *after* that confirmation. **Error-contract change:** a teardown whose tmux kill cannot be confirmed now raises (surfaced as HTTP 500 on `DELETE /sessions/{name}`) instead of reporting success — the registry rows are left intact and the operation is safe to re-run, which reconciles the survivor. Backend authors: `TerminalBackend.kill_session` must not return True for a merely-dispatched kill

  (the macOS runners ship only `python3`, so `python scripts/build_tui.py check` exited 127)

- set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET per matrix leg so delocate's minimum-OS check matches the Rust
  binary's actual floor instead of cibuildwheel's 10.9 default

- stop building and requiring a Windows wheel, and refuse Windows at import with an
  explanation: four modules import `fcntl` at module scope and the backend is tmux, so the
  sdist fallback installed but could not import

- stop building and requiring a macOS x86_64 (Intel) wheel: `cryptography` ships no
  Intel-macOS wheel at 49.0.0 or above, and CAO floors at `cryptography>=50.0.0` for two HIGH
  CVEs, so an Intel Mac cannot resolve its dependencies from wheels at all. Intel Macs now get
  a clean "no matching distribution" from pip rather than a wheel that installs and then fails.
  Every wheel CAO publishes is now both built and executed by CI.
