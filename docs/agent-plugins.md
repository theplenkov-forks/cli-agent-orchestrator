# Agent Plugins

> **Not the same thing as [Event Plugins](plugins.md).** CAO has two unrelated
> plugin systems. **Agent plugins** are portable packages of skills and MCP
> servers that conform to the open
> [Agent Plugins 1.0.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) specification
> and work across many agent clients. **Event plugins** are Python packages that
> run inside `cao-server` and react to CAO lifecycle events. Different formats,
> different audiences, different code. This page is about the first kind.

> **The committed pin lags by one release, and that is structural.** The operator
> package's `mcp.json` pins an exact published version (§7.2.1 allows a single
> `command` token, so the manifest cannot execute anything but a released
> artifact), which means it can only ever name a release that already exists —
> never the one being built. `scripts/build_agent_plugin.py` refuses a pin whose
> `cao-ops-mcp-server` does not bound its HTTP requests, and the release workflow's
> `regenerate-agent-plugin` job rebuilds the packages *after* publishing so the pin
> advances to the release containing that fix. Until such a release exists the
> committed package pins the newest published version; a plain rebuild still works,
> because the boundedness question is asked only when a build would change the pin
> or when `--require-bounded-client` is passed. How that question is answered, and
> what the lag means for `make check-agent-plugin`, are described under
> [CAO's own packages](#caos-own-packages).



> [!WARNING]
> **Installing an agent plugin runs untrusted code and content from that
> source.** A plugin's skills become instructions injected into your agents'
> system prompts, and its MCP servers become subprocesses on your machine.
> CAO implements **no trust model, no signing, and no provenance verification**
> for agent plugins — the specification defers all three to a future revision,
> and CAO inherits that deferral rather than inventing its own. Install plugins
> only from sources you would trust with a shell on your machine.

## What an agent plugin is

A directory with a `plugin.json` manifest at its root:

```text
my-plugin/
├── plugin.json          # required manifest
├── skills/              # optional; each immediate child is one Agent Skill
│   └── my-skill/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── mcp.json             # optional; MCP servers (see "MCP servers" below)
```

Because the format is an open specification rather than a CAO invention, the
same directory is installable by any client that implements Agent Plugins 1.0.0
— and CAO ships itself in that format too (see
[CAO's own packages](#caos-own-packages)). The clients CAO itself exercises end
to end are **Kiro CLI** and **Claude Code**; support in any other client is that
client's claim to make, not something CAO verifies.

## Prerequisites

Installing third-party agent plugins into CAO needs nothing beyond CAO itself.
The two prerequisites below apply to the **`cao` operator package** — the one a
*foreign* client installs to drive CAO — and are also stated in that package's
manifest `description`:

| Prerequisite | Why |
|---|---|
| **`uv` on `PATH`** | The packaged MCP server is launched via `uvx`. The specification allows only a single `command` token, so the package cannot bundle a launcher. |
| **A CAO API server at `http://127.0.0.1:9889`** (`cao-server`) | Every operator tool is an HTTP call to that server. |
| **`CAO_AUTH_LOCAL_TOKEN`, only when the CAO API has authentication enabled** | Every tool is a scope-gated HTTP call. The server attaches that token as `Authorization: Bearer …`, read from the environment of whatever client launched it — the package itself stores no credential. In IdP mode the client must also export the same `AUTH0_DOMAIN` / `CAO_AUTH_JWKS_URI` the API uses, so the server can tell the auth layer is on; in local-token mode the token alone is enough, because the same variable both enables auth and is the credential. With authentication disabled nothing is sent and no variable is needed. |

**The posture is localhost-only.** `SERVER_HOST` defaults to `127.0.0.1`, the
package never reaches a remote endpoint, and nothing in it opens a listening
socket. If you override `CAO_API_HOST` or `CAO_API_PORT` to a non-loopback
address, you have knowingly left that posture — CAO has not silently changed it.

CAO will **not** start a server for you. If `cao-server` is not running, an
operator tool call returns a structured error naming the failed operation and
its cause. Self-starting a long-lived daemon on a fixed local port would take
the decision of when CAO is listening away from you, so it is rejected rather
than merely unimplemented.

## Managing plugins

> [!NOTE]
> The command verb below is **provisional**. It is recorded as maintainer
> decision **M1** and is not settled: `docs/plugins.md` publicly promises
> `cao plugin list / info / enable / disable` as a future surface for *event*
> plugins, so taking the noun for agent plugins retracts a documented roadmap
> item. This page documents the recommended option; the decision must be
> recorded before the surface ships.

```bash
# Install from a local directory
cao plugin add ./path/to/my-plugin

# Install from a GitHub repository, optionally at a ref and/or subdirectory
cao plugin add https://github.com/owner/repo
cao plugin add https://github.com/owner/repo --ref v1.2.0 --subdir packages/my-plugin

# Check a candidate without installing it
cao plugin validate ./path/to/my-plugin
cao plugin validate ./path/to/my-plugin --json

# See what is installed, and which skill came from where
cao plugin list
cao plugin list --json

# Remove one (its persistent data is kept unless you ask otherwise)
cao plugin remove my-plugin
cao plugin remove my-plugin --purge-data
```

`--json` on `list` and `validate` emits a machine-readable report for CI and
scripting. `cao plugin add` and `cao plugin validate` exit non-zero when a
plugin is not loadable.

### Accepted git source spellings

Source-kind inference is syntactic; it does not probe the filesystem. Paths
beginning with `./`, `../`, `/`, or `~` are local, even when their names end in
`.git` or contain `@` and `:`. Prefix an ambiguous local name such as
`user@host:plugin` with `./`; without that prefix it is an SSH-style source
regardless of whether a same-named directory exists. The HTTP API also accepts
an explicit `kind: "path"`. Filesystem checks belong to local-source resolution,
not to choosing the source kind.

A git source is cloned only over **`https://` or `ssh://`** (URL or `scp`-style
`git@host:owner/repo.git`) and only from an **allowed host**: `github.com` by
default. Set `CAO_PLUGIN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to a comma-separated list of hostnames
to allow others (an internal GitLab or CodeCommit mirror, for example); the
list replaces the default, so include `github.com` if you still want it.
Entries are bare hostnames, matched case-insensitively: no scheme, port or
path (an entry like `host:8443` matches nothing). A source may name any port
on an allowed host. The same shape as `CAO_PROFILE_ALLOWED_HOSTS` for
profile downloads.

`file://`, `git://`, `http://` and remote-helper spellings such as `ext::` are
refused before any `git` process starts, as are URLs carrying a query string,
fragment or embedded credential, and locations that are not git URLs at all
(a local path reaching the git branch through the API, for instance). For a
repository on this machine, pass its directory as a plain path source instead.
Independently of that check, every `git` CAO runs is pinned to
`GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL=https:ssh` and `http.followRedirects=false`, so the
transport rule holds inside git too and an allowed host cannot redirect the
clone somewhere the allowlist never saw (a renamed repository therefore fails
with git's own message; retype the new location).

The `pip`/`uv` requirement spelling is accepted for the two forms that map
cleanly onto a transport, and rewritten before the clone:

| You type | CAO clones |
| --- | --- |
| `git+https://host/path` | `https://host/path` |
| `git+ssh://host/path` | `ssh://host/path` |

Every other `git+` form — `git+file://`, `git+git://`, `git+http://`, or a bare
`git+something` — is **refused** with a message naming the two supported forms.
Git would otherwise read `git+file` as the name of a remote helper and fail with
`fatal: remote helper 'git+file' aborted session`.

The same operations are available over the HTTP API — `GET/POST /plugins`,
`POST /plugins/validate`, `DELETE /plugins/{name}` — and in the web UI's
**Plugins** tab.

### Removing a plugin while a session is live

Two providers — Kiro CLI and OpenCode — read `SKILL.md` from disk *during* a
session rather than snapshotting it at launch. Removing a plugin can therefore
pull a skill out from under an agent that is mid-task and about to load it.

`cao plugin remove` checks running sessions and, if any profile references a
skill this plugin provides, reports which sessions and skills are affected and
asks for confirmation. It **warns**; it does not refuse — you may legitimately
want the plugin gone, and blocking removal while any long session runs would
make the store impossible to clean. `--yes` skips the prompt for scripted use.
The web UI applies the same gate before issuing its `DELETE`.

## Where things live

```text
~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/
├── agent-plugins/<name>/         # the plugin's own bytes; CAO never modifies them
├── agent-plugin-data/<name>/     # persistent plugin data; survives updates
└── skills/                       # the global skill store (projection target)
```

Both directories are created `0o700` (owner-only). `agent-plugin-data/` lives
*outside* `agent-plugins/` deliberately: an update replaces a plugin's package
bytes wholesale, and the specification requires persistent data survive that.
`cao plugin remove` keeps it; `--purge-data` deletes it.

## How plugin skills reach your agents

A plugin's skills are **projected** into the global skill store as managed
symlinks:

```text
~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/skills/<skill-name>
    -> ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/agent-plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>
```

That single mechanism reaches every provider through the pathway it already
uses — the runtime catalog, Copilot's baked `.agent.md`, Kiro's `skill://` globs,
and OpenCode's config symlink. See
[Agent-plugin-provided skills](skills.md#agent-plugin-provided-skills) for the details and
the collision rules.

On a system where symlink creation is unavailable (Windows without Developer
Mode or elevation), CAO falls back to copying and reports that it did. You can
make the choice explicit with `"skills": {"projection_mode": "copy"}` in
`settings.json`.

A copied projection carries a `.cao-projection.json` recording a digest of the
bytes CAO wrote and the skill name it belongs to, and CAO replaces or removes such
a directory only when both still hold. So a copy you edited in place is left alone
and reported rather than overwritten or swept, a copy relocated to another name
confers no ownership, and a regular file at a projected skill name is never
removed. See
[Agent-plugin-provided skills](skills.md#agent-plugin-provided-skills) for the
full rule.

## Validation and what gets reported

Every install and every `validate` produces a report of **findings**, each
citing the specification clause it enforces:

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fatal` | The plugin is rejected. Nothing is installed. |
| `skipped` | One skill, component type, or server entry was dropped. The rest still load. |

**A plugin never widens an agent's tool allowlist.** A plugin-provided MCP server
reaches an agent only if that agent's profile names it — `"*"`, an explicit
`@server-name`, or a matching glob in `allowedTools`. A glob is matched
**case-sensitively** against the servers actually delivered to that agent, so
`@plugin-*` grants a delivered `plugin-tools`, `@PLUGIN-*` grants nothing, and a
pattern matching nothing delivered grants nothing. Servers you declare in the
profile yourself are still granted automatically; only plugin-provided ones are
excluded.

This is deliberate and fail-closed. Role defaults enumerate what they trust by
name, and a plugin appears in no role default — so a `supervisor`
(`@cao-mcp-server`, `fs_read`, `fs_list`, with no `fs_write` and no
`execute_bash`, precisely so it must delegate) and a `reviewer` (read-only) keep
exactly their designed posture when you install a plugin. Plugin servers obey the
same rule every other tool obeys: appear in the allowlist or do not run.

The cost is that a freshly installed plugin is **inert until you name its
server**. That is the intended trade: you are present at the install, whereas the
silent widening it replaces was not visible at all. To grant one:

```yaml
allowedTools:
  - "fs_read"
  - "@plugin-tools"     # or "@plugin-*", or "*" for everything
```

See [Tool restrictions](tool-restrictions.md) for how `allowedTools` and roles
resolve.

A skill is validated over its **whole tree**, not just its top level, because
copy-mode projection copies the whole tree. A nested symlink that resolves outside
the plugin root (`skill.link_escapes_root`), one whose target is missing
(`skill.link_dangling`), a directory symlink forming a cycle
(`skill.link_cycle`), and a special file such as a FIFO or device
(`skill.special_entry`) each skip **that skill only** — its siblings and the rest
of the package still install. A `skills/<name>` that is itself a symlink
*contained* in the root stays permitted, as §4.1 requires.

Copy-mode projections are assembled in a staging directory and moved into place
with a single rename, so the projected path only ever contains a complete tree. A
failed copy leaves nothing behind: unmarked content at a projected path would be
indistinguishable from a skill you created yourself, which would make every retry
refuse to touch it. Staging lives beside the skills directory rather than inside
it, so no glob aimed at the skills directory can observe a partial copy.

An MCP defect is scoped to what it actually invalidates. A defect in the
**document** — not an object, a missing or mismatched `$schema`, an unknown
top-level key, or an `mcpServers` that is not an object — disables MCP for the
plugin, because there is no well-formed entry left to keep. A defect in **one
server entry** skips that entry and delivers its siblings, and the package stays
loadable, so `cao plugin validate` still exits 0. Every per-entry code
(`mcp.server_invalid`, `mcp.url_invalid`, `mcp.url_insecure`,
`mcp.headers_invalid`, `mcp.cwd_unsupported`, `mcp.transport_unsupported`) is
reported at install and launch rather than logged quietly — a missing tool is
otherwise invisible.
| `warning` | Reported; nothing was dropped. |
| `info` | Informational. |

Failure is deliberately granular. One broken skill inside an otherwise valid
plugin is skipped with a report while its siblings install normally; a missing
`skills/` directory is not an error at all; and a fatal manifest problem rejects
the plugin *before any component loads*, leaving your installed set byte-identical
to what it was.

Validation never reaches the network. CAO validates against schema bytes
committed to its own repository, because the specification forbids retrieving a
schema while loading a plugin — which also means a compromised schema host
cannot change what CAO considers valid.

The schema-pin checks compare the recorded source URL and each schema URL/ID
against their exact canonical values, separately from checking that the pin's
policy is documented. A hostname mentioned in policy prose is not a URL
validation rule.

## MCP servers

A plugin may declare MCP servers in an `mcp.json` beside its `plugin.json`. CAO
validates it against the pinned `mcp.schema.json`, maps each server into its
internal MCP configuration, and merges the result into the `mcpServers` of every
agent profile it installs — the same dict from which each provider's native MCP
form is already derived. So a declared server reaches Kiro's agent JSON and
OpenCode's `opencode.json` with no per-provider work.

### Which providers receive plugin MCP servers

| When | Providers |
|---|---|
| **Install time** — written into a config file the CLI reads later | `kiro_cli`, `opencode_cli` |
| **Launch time** — recomputed each time a terminal is created | `claude_code`, `codex`, `kimi_cli`, `cursor_cli`, `copilot_cli`, `antigravity_cli`, `omp`, `grok_cli`, `mcode` |
| **Never** — the provider builds no MCP configuration at all | `hermes`, `mock_cli` |

The last row is *reported*, not silent: installing an agent for one of those
providers emits an `mcp.provider_unsupported` finding naming each server that
will not arrive. Only MCP is affected — the plugin's skills are delivered
normally.

Launch-time delivery is recomputed rather than persisted on purpose: the mapped
paths are absolute `${PLUGIN_ROOT}`/`${PLUGIN_DATA}` expansions, so a stored copy
would go stale the moment `CAO_HOME_DIR` moved or a `--force` reinstall relocated
the root.

The rows above are maintained by hand, but the *classification they describe* is
machine-checked: `test_mcp_launch_delivery.py` asserts that every `ProviderType`
value falls into exactly one delivery bucket, so a newly supported provider cannot
be added without a test failing. Nothing parses this table — if you change the
code, change these rows too.

When the merge happens matters, and it is worth knowing as an operator:

- **`cao install <agent>`** picks up whatever plugins are installed at that
  moment.
- **`cao plugin add` / `cao plugin remove`** re-materialize the provider configs
  of agents you have already installed, so a plugin's servers appear on the
  agents you own without reinstalling each one, and are withdrawn when the plugin
  is removed. This is not cosmetic: `mcpServers` is written into each provider's
  config file and never re-read, so a removed plugin's servers must be *actively*
  taken out of those files — otherwise a provider would keep trying to launch a
  binary that removal just deleted from disk.

What "withdrawn" means depends on how a provider stores its config, and the
difference is deliberate rather than an inconsistency:

- **Kiro and Copilot** rewrite the agent's own file (`<name>.json`,
  `<name>.agent.md`) wholesale on every refresh, so a removed plugin's server is
  simply **absent** afterwards.
- **OpenCode** shares one `opencode.json` that CAO edits *in place*, and CAO must
  never delete a key it might not own. A removed plugin's server is therefore
  **disabled** (`"enabled": false`), not deleted: OpenCode will not spawn it, and
  re-installing the plugin re-enables it. The trade is that the disabled entry —
  with its now-dangling command — stays visible in `opencode mcp list` until you
  remove it by hand. Pruning it outright needs provenance CAO does not yet record
  and is tracked as a follow-up.

Server names collide the way skill names do, and are resolved by the same kind of
rule rather than by timing. **A server your profile already declares always
wins** — including CAO's own `cao-mcp-server` — and a plugin's same-named entry is
dropped with a report rather than merged, renamed, or prefixed. Between two
plugins claiming one name, the lexicographically smallest plugin name wins.
Renaming would be worse than dropping: the plugin's own documentation, and any
skill it ships that names the server, would describe something that no longer
answers. On OpenCode, that shared `opencode.json` may also hold servers **you**
wrote by hand; CAO applies the same rule there, dropping a plugin server with a
report rather than overwriting an entry it cannot prove it placed.

The same restraint applies to the per-agent tool grant OpenCode needs. CAO **merges
into** `agent.<id>.tools` and withdraws only the `<servername>*` keys it recorded
granting (in a `cao-grants.json` sidecar beside `opencode.json`) or can place inside
its own plugin store — so a `model`, `prompt` or `"bash": false` you set on a
CAO-installed agent survives every install, refresh and uninstall. See
[`opencode-cli.md`](opencode-cli.md) for the exact rule.

> **A plugin's MCP servers are commands the plugin chose, run on your machine
> with your user's permissions.** CAO expands only the two placeholders below,
> keeps every server's working directory and `./`-rooted command inside the
> plugin's own directory, and warns about credential-shaped values — but it does
> not sandbox the process, and it cannot: an MCP server is meant to do real work.
> The consent gate is the untrusted-content warning printed at install time, which
> is why installing is an explicit act and why `cao plugin validate` exists to let
> you read `mcp.json` before you install it. CAO's own localhost-only posture is
> unchanged by this: nothing here opens a port or accepts a remote connection.

**An unusable `mcp.json` disables MCP for that plugin and nothing else** — its
skills still install and deliver. One bad server entry likewise invalidates only
that entry; its siblings load.

Two placeholders are expanded, and only these two:

| Placeholder | Expands to |
|---|---|
| `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` | the plugin's own directory |
| `${PLUGIN_DATA}` | the plugin's persistent data directory |

They are expanded **only** in `args` elements, `env` *values*, and `cwd` — never
in `env` keys, `command`, `url`, or header names and values. Expansion is
single-pass: text introduced by a replacement is not re-scanned, and any other
`${...}` is left exactly as written. CAO does not perform any further
substitution on a mapped entry, because the specification forbids it.

Some entries are rejected, always with a report and never silently:

- **`command` must be one token.** It is never shell-split. A `./`-rooted
  command must resolve inside the plugin root.
- **`env` must not declare `PLUGIN_ROOT` or `PLUGIN_DATA`.** CAO supplies both
  itself, after applying the plugin's own `env`; an entry that tries to override
  them is invalidated.
- **`cwd` must stay contained**, checked after expansion against whichever root
  it is anchored to. Omitted, it defaults to the plugin root. How it then reaches
  the agent depends on what the target provider's config format can express,
  which is a per-provider fact rather than one rule:

  | Delivery | Providers | How |
  |---|---|---|
  | Native field | `codex`, `antigravity_cli`, `opencode_cli`, `kimi_cli` | The format documents a working-directory key, so CAO writes it directly. Codex `mcp_servers.<id>.cwd` and Antigravity `cwd` are documented; OpenCode's `McpLocalConfig.cwd` and FastMCP's `StdioMCPServer.cwd` (Kimi) are in their schemas. |
  | `/bin/sh` wrapper | `grok_cli`, `mcode`, `kiro_cli`, `claude_code`, `cursor_cli`, `copilot_cli`, `omp` | The format has **no** working-directory key, so the command becomes `/bin/sh -c 'cd -- "$1" && shift && exec "$@"' cao-cwd-shim <cwd> <command> <args…>`. `exec` replaces the shell, the environment passes through, and argument boundaries survive because each argument stays a separate argv element. |
  | Nothing to carry | `hermes`, `mock_cli` | These build no MCP configuration at all and already report `mcp.provider_unsupported` per server. |

  Each row was checked against that vendor's own MCP documentation on
  2026-09-16. The table is exhaustive over CAO's providers and a test asserts
  that, so a newly added provider cannot silently inherit a policy. Only
  agent-plugin entries are wrapped — a `cwd` you wrote in a profile yourself is
  passed through untouched.
- **A working directory this host cannot honour is reported, not ignored.** On a
  host with no `/bin/sh`, a wrapper provider's stdio servers are skipped with
  `mcp.cwd_unsupported` rather than started in the wrong directory; remote
  servers in the same document are unaffected.
- **A remote `url` must be `https`, or `http` to loopback.** Cleartext to any
  other host is refused (`mcp.url_insecure`) because the plugin author, not the
  operator, chose the endpoint. Userinfo credentials, a fragment, a non-HTTP
  scheme and a missing host are refused as `mcp.url_invalid`. The schema's
  `format: uri` cannot express any of this — in JSON Schema `format` is an
  annotation, not an assertion.
- **Header names must be RFC 9110 tokens and values visible ASCII** (space and
  tab allowed); otherwise `mcp.headers_invalid`. Two names differing only in case
  are the same field supplied twice, so the entry is refused rather than
  silently resolved to whichever the serializer happens to keep. An
  authorization-shaped *value* stays a warning and is still delivered.
- **A transport the target provider cannot carry is skipped**, not failed over
  to a different one. Where the two vocabularies merely differ, the name is
  translated rather than refused — Grok writes `streamable-http` as its own
  `http`.
- **A server name the target provider cannot express is skipped.** The
  specification puts no pattern on `mcpServers` keys, but a provider's own config
  format may: MiniMax Code accepts only `^[a-z][a-z0-9]*(?:[._-][a-z0-9]+)*$`, so
  a server called `Acme` is dropped with a report for that provider and delivered
  normally to every other. Reported rather than passed through because MiniMax's
  serializer *rejects* such a name while a terminal is being created — passing it
  on would cost you the agent, not just the tool. Codex applies the same rule with
  its own shape, `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`, because there the name becomes a segment of a
  TOML dotted path in a `-c` override: a dot would nest the entry under the wrong
  table, and the provider raises during terminal creation. Environment *keys* need
  no such rule on Codex — they are written as one quoted-key inline table on the
  value side, which expresses any key the specification allows.
- **Credential-shaped `env` and `headers` values are warned about**, never
  blocked. The specification forbids credentials there; use `cao env` and CAO's
  secret gate for real secrets.

## CAO's own packages

CAO ships itself as two agent plugins, so any Agent-Plugins-compatible client
can drive a CAO session without CAO-specific integration code:

| Package | Install this if you are… | Skills | Also ships |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`cao`](../agent-plugin/cao) | **an operator** driving CAO from another client | `cao-session-management`, `cao-agent-routing`, `cao-supervisor-protocols`, `cao-worker-protocols` | the `cao-ops` MCP server |
| [`cao-contributor`](../agent-plugin/cao-contributor) | **a contributor** extending CAO itself | `cao-provider`, `cao-plugin` | — |

The skill names are the folder names you will see under
`~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/skills/` after installing, which is what makes a
collision report readable when one of them clashes with a skill you already have.
Both packages are generated from CAO's own `skills/` directory by
`scripts/build_agent_plugin.py`, and `make check-agent-plugin` fails if the
generated packages drift from it — so this table, the packages, and the shipped
skills cannot disagree for long.

Each package also carries a small **Claude Code compatibility overlay**:
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (identity only, mirrored from `plugin.json`) and,
for `cao`, a `.mcp.json` byte-identical to `mcp.json`. Claude Code (verified
against 2.1.226) discovers `skills/` from the standard layout unchanged but
reads identity and MCP servers only from those two files; every other client
ignores dot-prefixed entries, and the validator discovers fixed locations only,
so the overlay changes nothing for Agent-Plugins-conformant clients. It is
generated and drift-guarded like every other package file.

The operator package's `mcp.json` declares one server, `cao-ops`, launched as
`uvx --from cli-agent-orchestrator==<version> cao-ops-mcp-server` — the
**outside-a-session** tool surface. The in-session `cao-mcp-server` is
deliberately not packaged: it derives its identity from a `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` that
a foreign client does not have, so its orchestration tools would fail on first
call. The version is pinned exactly, and the build refuses to write a pin that
is not already published on PyPI. `cao-contributor` ships no `mcp.json` at all:
authoring skills work through the host agent's own tools and need no CAO
runtime, so the `uv` and `cao-server` prerequisites do not apply to it.

The build also refuses to write a pin whose published `cao-ops-mcp-server` does
not bound its HTTP requests, and it decides that by **inspecting the published
sdist** for a `timeout=` on every `requests.*` call site. Not by comparing against
a version floor: a floor encodes "which release contains the fix" as a constant
somebody has to move on every release, and one set ahead of every published
version refuses legitimate patch releases outright. If the artifact cannot be
inspected — PyPI unreachable, no sdist, module renamed — the build says *that*
rather than reporting the release as unbounded. `--skip-publish-check` suppresses
this fetch along with the publication probe, so a local rebuild needs no network.

Because the pin lags, `make check-agent-plugin` verifies the committed packages
**at the version they were built at**, and its only version constraint is that
this version is not *ahead* of `pyproject.toml`. Releasing bumps `pyproject.toml`
on `main` before `regenerate-agent-plugin` repins, and demanding equality in that
window would fail CI on `main` and on every open PR for something that is not
wrong. Everything else the check covers — drift in any generated byte, validator
findings, allowlist agreement, `mcp.json` conformance — is unaffected. Strict
equality lives behind `--check --require-current-pin`, which that job runs after
it has pushed, so a forgotten repin is still caught, just not on everyone
else's PR.

```bash
# From a clone
cao plugin add ./agent-plugin/cao

# From GitHub, without cloning
cao plugin add https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator --subdir agent-plugin/cao
```

Install `cao` if you want to *use* a fleet; install `cao-contributor` if you
want to *change CAO*. Keeping them separate means each package's skills all
serve one story, rather than every foreign agent carrying repo-development
instructions it will never act on.

Both packages are generated from CAO's canonical `skills/` tree by
`scripts/build_agent_plugin.py` and committed, with `make check-agent-plugin`
failing CI on any drift.

## Trying it in a client

Two routes reach a client, and they are worth keeping apart. **Through CAO** —
`cao plugin add` then `cao install`, which materializes the plugin's skills and
MCP servers into whatever provider you install for. **Directly in a foreign
client** — install the package with that client's own plugin mechanism, which is
what makes the package portable rather than CAO-specific.

Everything below starts from a clone:

```sh
cao plugin validate ./agent-plugin/cao     # loadable? skills named? mcp present?
cao plugin add ./agent-plugin/cao
```

### Kiro CLI — native, both routes

Kiro reads skills natively. `cao install <profile> --provider kiro_cli` writes
`skill://` resource globs and the `cao-ops` server straight into the agent JSON,
so the plugin's four skills and its MCP server are configured at launch:

```sh
cao install developer --provider kiro_cli
# then inspect what CAO emitted:
#   $CAO_AGENTS_DIR/developer.json -> resources[] has skill:// globs,
#   mcpServers.cao-ops has PLUGIN_ROOT/PLUGIN_DATA expanded to real paths,
#   allowedTools does NOT contain "@cao-ops" -- see the grant rule below
```

**Delivery is not authorisation, and the difference is deliberate.** A
plugin-provided MCP server is configured into the profile, but CAO does **not**
append `@<server>` to an `allowedTools` list that did not name it. Per issue #573
AC7, the alternative is worse: `resolve_allowed_tools` appends `@<server>` to any
allowlist that is not `"*"`, so an unrelated `cao plugin add` would silently widen
every managed agent — including the roles whose defaults exist to *deny*.
`supervisor` is `@cao-mcp-server, fs_read, fs_list` with no `fs_write` and no
`execute_bash` precisely so that seat must delegate; `reviewer` is read-only by
the same design. The rule is fail-closed and is not special-cased by role, because
role defaults enumerate what they trust **by name**.

An operator opts in by naming the server in the profile's `allowedTools`:

```yaml
allowedTools:
  - "@builtin"
  - fs_read
  - "@cao-ops"     # or a matching glob, or "*" — then it is granted
```

The accepted cost is that a freshly installed plugin's tools are inert until
named. That is visible, because the operator just ran the install; the widening it
replaces was silent. Both halves are asserted by the dog-food recording
([steps 3 and 3b](#verified-by-dog-fooding)).

Because Kiro powers install Agent Plugins natively, the same directory is also
installable directly as a power — no CAO-specific packaging step.

### Claude Code — verified against 2.1.226

Claude Code discovers the standard `skills/` layout unchanged, but reads package
**identity** only from `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and **MCP servers** only from
a root `.mcp.json`. Both are generated into each package (see
[CAO's own packages](#caos-own-packages)), so the strict validator passes:

```sh
claude plugin validate ./agent-plugin/cao
```

Install it through Claude Code's marketplace flow (see Claude Code's own plugin
documentation for the current command names), then confirm two things
independently: the four skills are discovered, and the `cao-ops` server appears
with its tools callable. With no `cao-server` running, a tool call returns a
structured error naming the operation and the cause rather than hanging; start
one and the same call returns real data:

```sh
cao-server &                 # then, from the client, call cao-ops list_sessions
                             # -> {"success": true, "sessions": [...]}
```

That two-state check is the useful one — it proves the tool is really wired to a
local CAO rather than merely registered.

### Antigravity CLI, and Gemini-family clients

Antigravity CLI is a CAO provider, and it receives skills by **runtime prompt
injection** plus the `load_skill` MCP tool rather than by reading a skill
directory (see [skills.md](skills.md) for the per-provider mechanism table):

```sh
cao install developer --provider antigravity_cli
```

The plugin's skills reach it through CAO's delivery, so no client-side plugin
install is required. For any Gemini-family or other client that accepts an MCP
server configuration, `agent-plugin/cao/mcp.json` is the portable declaration to
copy — it is the same `mcpServers` shape the standard defines, pinned to a
published `cli-agent-orchestrator` version, so it needs no CAO-specific
translation.

## Verified by dog-fooding

The pipeline that installs those packages is exercised against itself by a
**gated** recorder: CAO installs its own [`cao`](../agent-plugin/cao) agent
plugin through its own `cao plugin` / `cao install` commands and asserts the
result at every step. The GIF below is the captured run — but the prose is not
the evidence, the **gate** is: the recorder only produces a GIF when the
asserting script exits `0` and prints its `PASS` marker, so a regressed pipeline
cannot make a green recording. The CI job
`Agent Plugins dog-food (shift-left recording)` runs it on every change.

![CAO installing its own cao agent plugin through its own pipeline, asserting each step](media/agent-plugins-dogfood-demo.gif)

What each step asserts, and why it is the load-bearing one:

1. **`cao plugin validate`** — the manifest is loadable, its four shipped skills
   are named, and `mcp_present` with the `cao-ops` server.
2. **`cao plugin add`** — each skill is projected into the skill store as a
   symlink whose target resolves into the plugin store (asserted on the link
   target, not on `ls` output).
3. **`cao install … --provider kiro_cli`** — the delivery fix, end to end: the
   agent JSON carries the `skill://` globs **and** `cao-ops` with
   `PLUGIN_ROOT`/`PLUGIN_DATA` expanded to real paths in `env`, and **no**
   `x-cao-pre-expanded` marker leaked. The profile names no `allowedTools`, so
   `@cao-ops` is **absent** from the resolved list — the fail-closed rule below,
   asserted where it takes effect. A second install (step 3b) of a profile that
   *does* declare `allowedTools: ["@builtin", fs_read, "@cao-ops"]` gets the
   grant, so the recording proves both halves of the rule rather than one.
4. **`cao install … --provider opencode_cli`** — `opencode.json` gets a real
   boolean `"enabled": true`; and installing over a user's own same-named entry
   **preserves it and emits a finding** rather than clobbering it.
5. **`cao plugin remove cao`** — cross-provider removal: **absent** from the
   rewritten Kiro/Copilot config; **disabled** (`"enabled": false`) on OpenCode's
   shared config. The opt-in profile keeps its operator-written `@cao-ops` entry
   through the removal — CAO withdraws the server it configured, not the
   allowlist entry it never wrote. The offline run asserts those written shapes;
   a live-gated step additionally observes, via `opencode mcp list` and a
   sentinel wrapper, that a disabled entry is reported `disabled` and **no
   subprocess is spawned** for it (verified against OpenCode 1.18.15).

The runnable example, the offline-vs-live assertion matrix, and the recorder are
in [`examples/agent-plugins/agent-plugins-dogfood/`](../examples/agent-plugins/agent-plugins-dogfood/README.md).

## Security posture, stated plainly

- **No trust model.** Installing a plugin is equivalent to running untrusted
  code and content from its source. There is no signing and no provenance check.
- **Prompt injection is the main exposure.** Plugin skill content flows into
  agents' system prompts. This is not new — `extra_skill_dirs` already admits
  third-party skill content — but installing a plugin is one command rather than
  a deliberate settings edit. `cao plugin list` shows which plugin contributed
  each skill, so provenance is always recoverable.
- **Paths are contained.** Every path a plugin references is resolved with
  realpath and confined to that plugin's own root. A symlink whose target
  resolves inside the root is allowed; one that escapes is rejected, whatever
  the literal path looks like.
- **No secrets in package data.** The specification forbids credentials in MCP
  `env` and `headers`. CAO warns when a value looks credential-shaped and does
  not treat it as a supported mechanism. Use `cao env` and CAO's secret gate
  instead.
- **A plugin's MCP tools are not auto-authorised.** Installing a plugin configures
  its MCP servers into managed profiles but does **not** add `@<server>` to an
  `allowedTools` list that did not name it, so `cao plugin add` cannot widen the
  deny-by-design roles. Naming the server (or a matching glob, or `"*"`) is the
  operator's opt-in — see [Kiro CLI](#kiro-cli--native-both-routes).
- **No schema fetch at load time.** Pinned bytes only.
