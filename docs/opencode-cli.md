# OpenCode CLI Provider

> ⚠️ **Experimental.** Multi-agent orchestration (`assign` / `send_message` back to a supervisor) now uses a temporary OpenCode-specific inbox polling fallback for [#203](https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator/issues/203). This prevents pending supervisor inbox messages from getting stuck after the OpenCode TUI settles, but delivery is still not fully unified with the immediate and watchdog paths until [#115](https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator/pull/115) replaces them with a single coordinator.

## Overview

The OpenCode CLI provider enables CLI Agent Orchestrator (CAO) to work with **OpenCode**, a terminal-based AI assistant with a native agent system. OpenCode uses Markdown files with YAML frontmatter as its agent format — nearly identical to CAO's own profile format — making this integration especially clean.

## Prerequisites

1. **OpenCode binary** — install from [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai):
   ```bash
   npm install -g opencode-ai
   # or
   curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
   ```
2. **Node.js 18+** — required by OpenCode for its plugin system
3. **tmux 3.3+** — required by CAO for terminal management
4. **API credentials** — configure whichever model provider you want OpenCode to use (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) per [OpenCode's auth docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/auth)

### First-launch delay

On its **first ever launch** against a fresh CAO config directory (`~/.aws/opencode/`), OpenCode runs `npm install @opencode-ai/plugin` — roughly 57 MB of dependencies that take **5–30 seconds** to install. The TUI will appear blank until the install completes. This is expected; CAO's 120-second initialization timeout covers it automatically.

Subsequent launches complete in ~2 seconds.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install agent profiles

```bash
# Built-in profiles
cao install code_supervisor --provider opencode_cli
cao install developer --provider opencode_cli
cao install reviewer --provider opencode_cli

# Custom or example profiles
cao install examples/assign/data_analyst.md --provider opencode_cli
cao install examples/assign/report_generator.md --provider opencode_cli
```

### 2. Start the CAO server

```bash
uv run cao-server
```

### 3. Launch an agent

```bash
# Standard launch — shows tool summary and asks for confirmation
cao launch --agents developer --provider opencode_cli

# Skip CAO's launch-time confirmation prompt (tool restrictions still enforced)
cao launch --agents developer --provider opencode_cli --auto-approve

# Specify model override
cao launch --agents developer --provider opencode_cli --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6

# Unrestricted access — install the profile with allowedTools: ["*"] first.
# `cao launch --yolo` is a no-op on opencode_cli (see Known Limitations).
cao install developer --provider opencode_cli   # profile must have allowedTools: ["*"]
cao launch --agents developer --provider opencode_cli
```

Via HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9889/sessions?provider=opencode_cli&agent_profile=developer"
```

## Config Isolation

CAO runs OpenCode with `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` and `OPENCODE_CONFIG` both pointing at `~/.aws/opencode/`, which is separate from the user's personal OpenCode config at `~/.config/opencode/`. This means:

- CAO-installed agents are visible in OpenCode's agent picker alongside the built-ins
- CAO's MCP wiring (`opencode.json`) never touches the user's personal setup
- Switching between `cao launch` and personal `opencode` usage is safe — they use independent config trees

Storage layout:

```

## Permission and Tool Mapping

OpenCode enforces permissions natively via `permission:` YAML frontmatter in each agent file. CAO translates its `allowedTools` list to an OpenCode `permission:` dict at install time — **no entry in `utils/tool_mapping.py` is needed**.

CAO owns the permission decision, so the translator only ever emits `allow` or `deny`. The `ask` value — OpenCode's native runtime prompt — is intentionally never written, which keeps OpenCode aligned with the other CAO providers (Kiro, Q, Claude Code) where allowed tools are allowed outright.

### Summary

| CAO category | OpenCode tools enabled |
|---|---|
| `execute_bash` | `bash` |
| `fs_read` | `read` |
| `fs_write` | `edit`, `write` |
| `fs_list` | `glob`, `grep` |
| `fs_*` | `read`, `edit`, `write`, `glob`, `grep` |
| `@builtin` | none — a selector for provider chrome, not a tool grant (as in `utils/tool_mapping.py`) |
| `@<mcp-server-name>` | Handled in `opencode.json` (not frontmatter) |

Tools not in any enabled category default to `deny`. The following tools have hardcoded policies regardless of `allowedTools`:

| Tool | Policy | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | deny | Sub-agents escape CAO's terminal tracking |
| `question` | deny | Blocks unattended flows indefinitely |
| `webfetch`, `websearch`, `codesearch` | deny | Network egress — opt-in only |
| `todowrite`, `skill` | allow | In-memory / additive, no side-effects |

To allow all 13 tools including the above, set `allowedTools: ["*"]` in the profile and re-run `cao install`. Unlike the other providers, `cao launch --yolo` does **not** widen permissions at runtime on `opencode_cli` — see [`cao launch --yolo` is install-time only](#cao-launch---yolo-is-install-time-only) below.

### `cao launch --auto-approve`

`--auto-approve` on `cao launch` matches the repo-wide semantics: it skips CAO's launch-time confirmation prompt only. Tool restrictions are still enforced, and this flag does not modify any files in `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`. It has **no** `cao install` counterpart — install-time permissions are driven entirely by the profile's `allowedTools` / `role`.

## Skills

CAO skills (e.g. `cao-supervisor-protocols`, `cao-worker-protocols`) are exposed to OpenCode agents through OpenCode's **native `skill` tool** with progressive loading — they are **not** baked into the agent's system prompt.

At `cao install --provider opencode_cli` time, CAO creates a symlink:

```
~/.aws/opencode/skills → ~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/skills/
```

OpenCode auto-discovers `<OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR>/skills/` and makes its contents available through the `skill` tool. Metadata (name, description) is listed up front; full skill bodies are loaded on demand. This means:

- Skill additions or removals under `~/.aws/cli-agent-orchestrator/skills/` take effect on the next OpenCode launch with no reinstall required.
- The agent's system prompt stays lean — only `profile.system_prompt`/`profile.prompt` is written to the `.md` body, with no catalog injection.
- CAO's `load_skill` MCP tool remains available as a second path to the same content (cross-provider parity).

## Status Detection

The provider detects terminal state from the tmux capture buffer (ANSI-stripped):

| State | Marker |
|---|---|
| `IDLE` | `ctrl+p commands` footer, no `esc interrupt` |
| `PROCESSING` | `esc interrupt` footer keybind |
| `COMPLETED` | `▣ <agent> · <model> · Ns` completion marker followed by idle footer |
| `WAITING_USER_ANSWER` | `△ Permission required` or `△ Always allow` heading |
| `ERROR` | Fallback — no state marker matched |

## MCP Server Wiring

`cao install --provider opencode_cli` writes MCP server declarations into `~/.aws/opencode/opencode.json`:

- Each `mcpServers` entry from the agent profile is added under the top-level `mcp` key
- The server's tools are default-denied globally (`"<servername>*": false` under `tools`)
- Re-enabled per-agent under `agent.<agent_id>.tools`
- An entry carries `cwd` when its source declares one. Agent-plugin servers always
  do — their working directory defaults to that agent plugin's `PLUGIN_ROOT` — so an agent plugin
  whose command or arguments are relative to its own directory starts in the right
  place rather than in OpenCode's workspace directory

The agent ID is the profile's resolved `name:` — the same identifier used for the installed `.md` filename and the runtime `opencode --agent <id>` argument. This keeps the filename, the `--agent` arg, and the `opencode.json` key aligned for any profile name. (Install rejects a `name:` containing a path separator outright; `to_opencode_agent_id` still flattens `/` to `__` as defence in depth for any other caller.)

Because the ID comes from the resolved `name:` rather than the file name, two
different profile files can resolve to the same ID. `cao install` refuses the
second install rather than overwriting the first, naming both profiles so one
can be renamed. Only an installed profile owns an ID: a packaged built-in or an
uninstalled local profile with the same `name:` does not block. Ownership is
read from the installed context copy at its destination path (the configured
`agents.dirs.cao_installed` directory, and the default directory as well when an
override is configured), not from profile discovery, and the same check guards
installs for every provider, since they all write that copy. The agent file in
`OPENCODE_AGENTS_DIR` is probed too, under that directory's own case rules, so a
name that differs from an installed one only in case is refused where that
directory folds case even when the context directory does not. A context copy
written by a CAO version before the `x-cao-source-stem` marker existed cannot
prove which profile it belongs to; the error tells you to delete that copy and
reinstall, and an agent file left behind by a deleted context copy is refused
the same way.

### Your `agent.<id>` entry is yours to edit

`opencode.json` is a shared file that you are expected to hand-edit, so CAO **merges
into** `agent.<agent_id>` rather than rewriting it. A `model`, `prompt`,
`temperature` or tool policy you set on a CAO-installed agent — including a
`"bash": false` or a grant for a server of your own — survives every `cao install`,
every agent-plugin refresh, and the uninstall.

Withdrawing a grant is therefore restricted to keys CAO can *prove* are its own:

- keys recorded in `cao-grants.json`, a sidecar CAO writes next to `opencode.json`
  listing the `<servername>*` keys it granted per agent, and
- `<servername>*` for any `mcp` entry whose paths resolve inside CAO's agent-plugin store,
  which keeps grants from installs predating the sidecar cleanable

A `<servername>*` key CAO has no record of and cannot place in the agent-plugin store is
left alone rather than deleted on a guess. Deleting `cao-grants.json` is safe; it
only costs CAO the first of the two proofs.

One exception to "your tool policy survives", and it predates this behaviour: a
grant is *re-applied* on every refresh, so setting `"<servername>*": false` by hand
on a server CAO grants this agent is overwritten back to `true` the next time the
agent is installed or a plugin changes. To keep such a server switched off, remove
it from the agent's profile rather than denying it here. Reinstalling an agent whose profile no
longer declares `mcpServers` withdraws CAO's grants for it, and drops the
`agent.<agent_id>` entry entirely only when nothing but those grants was in it.

`CAO_TERMINAL_ID` is **not** written to `opencode.json`. OpenCode spawns MCP subprocesses that inherit the tmux window's environment, so the terminal ID propagates naturally — the same mechanism Kiro uses.

## End-to-End Testing

```bash
# Install profiles first
cao install examples/assign/data_analyst.md --provider opencode_cli
cao install examples/assign/report_generator.md --provider opencode_cli
cao install developer --provider opencode_cli

# Start CAO server
uv run cao-server

# Run all OpenCode CLI e2e tests
uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/test_assign.py -k opencode -v

# Run a single test
uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/test_assign.py::TestOpenCodeCliAssign::test_assign_with_callback -v
```

The `test_assign_with_callback` test validates all four orchestration modes:
- **assign** (non-blocking): supervisor terminal created and stays IDLE
- **send_message** (inbox delivery): worker pushes result to supervisor inbox
- **status transitions**: IDLE → PROCESSING → COMPLETED across concurrent terminals
- **handoff** (blocking): inbox delivery triggers supervisor state transition

## Known Limitations

### `cao launch --yolo` is install-time only

Unlike every other CAO provider, `opencode_cli` does **not** honour `cao launch --yolo` at runtime. Permissions are baked into the installed agent's frontmatter `permission:` block at `cao install` time and cannot be loosened by a launch flag.

Root cause: OpenCode's TUI (the mode CAO drives) has no equivalent to `--dangerously-skip-permissions` / `--yolo` / `--trust-all-tools`. The flag exists only on the `opencode run` headless one-shot command, which CAO does not use. Tracked upstream in [sst/opencode#8463](https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/8463) and sibling issues.

**To get unrestricted access on `opencode_cli`:**

```bash
# 1. Edit the profile's frontmatter so it contains:
#    allowedTools: ["*"]

# 2. Re-run cao install — this rewrites the permission: block with all tools set to allow.
cao install my_agent --provider opencode_cli

# 3. Launch normally (omit --yolo — it would emit a warning and still only honour what's installed).
cao launch --agents my_agent --provider opencode_cli
```

Runtime permission bypass support remains unavailable for OpenCode's TUI mode. CAO can revisit this either with a temp-agent workaround or by consuming an upstream TUI flag once one ships.

### Project-local `opencode.json` override

OpenCode's config merge precedence places a project-local `opencode.json` in the current working directory **above** `OPENCODE_CONFIG` (the CAO-managed file). If you `cao launch` in a directory that has its own `opencode.json` with conflicting `agent.<name>.tools` or `tools` entries, CAO's MCP wiring can be silently overridden for that agent.

**Workaround:** remove or rename the project-local `opencode.json` before launching CAO, or move it under `.opencode/` (a subdirectory OpenCode also searches but at a lower priority level).

### Scrolling enters tmux copy mode

When you scroll (mouse wheel or trackpad) inside a CAO-managed OpenCode terminal, tmux enters copy mode instead of scrolling the TUI conversation history. This is intentional.

CAO launches OpenCode with `OPENCODE_DISABLE_MOUSE=1`, which prevents OpenCode from requesting application mouse-reporting mode (`\x1b[?1000h`). Without that request, tmux does not forward scroll events to the OpenCode process — it intercepts them and enters copy mode instead.

The reason for this trade-off: if OpenCode owned scroll events, scrolling the conversation history would move the completion marker (`▣ <agent> · <model> · Ns`) off screen. The footer (`ctrl+p commands`, `esc interrupt`) is pinned to the bottom of the TUI and remains visible regardless of scroll position, so IDLE and PROCESSING detection are unaffected. But COMPLETED detection requires both the completion marker and the idle footer to be present simultaneously in the captured frame — if the marker has scrolled away, CAO never detects COMPLETED even after the agent finishes. Disabling mouse keeps the frame locked to the most recent render.

Press `q` or `Escape` to exit copy mode. If you need to read earlier conversation history, use the `get_output` API endpoint or the `/terminals/<id>/output` endpoint to retrieve the full captured log.

### `opencode.json` concurrent writes

Parallel `cao install --provider opencode_cli` invocations (e.g., from a batch script) can race on the shared `~/.aws/opencode/opencode.json` file. The second writer may clobber the first's agent entry. **Sequential installs are safe.** File locking is deferred to a future release.

`cao-grants.json` is written atomically (temp file + rename), so it is never observed
half-written — but it is a whole-file write like `opencode.json`, so it races the same
way under parallel installs.

## Troubleshooting

### First-launch blank TUI (5–30 seconds)

OpenCode installs `@opencode-ai/plugin` into `~/.aws/opencode/node_modules/` on the first launch. The terminal will appear blank until `npm install` completes. CAO's 120-second initialization timeout covers this automatically.

To pre-populate `node_modules/` before the first CAO launch (optional):
```bash
OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.aws/opencode opencode --help
```

### "Unknown provider" error from the server

Ensure the CAO server running on port 9889 is the **dev version**, not the pre-installed binary:
```bash
# Kill any stale installed binary
pkill -f 'cao-server'
# Start the dev server
uv run cao-server
```

### Authentication / model errors

OpenCode itself handles model authentication. Verify your credentials are set for the model provider you want to use. Check `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (your personal config) for provider API keys, or set them via environment variables before launching.

### Permission prompt blocking an automated flow

CAO emits only `allow` or `deny` in the permission frontmatter, so `△ Permission required` should not appear for CAO-managed tools. If it does:
1. Verify the profile's `allowedTools` / `role` grants the tool in question and reinstall — CAO translates allowed tools directly to `permission: allow`.
2. If the prompt comes from a tool outside CAO's vocabulary, respond to it manually in the tmux window, or use `--yolo` to disable all restrictions **(DANGEROUS — allows any command including `aws`, `rm`, `curl`)**.

### Status stuck as `PROCESSING`

This can happen if:
- OpenCode launched but the TUI hasn't painted yet (transient — the poller recovers)
- A `node_modules` install is still in progress (wait up to 120s)
- The `opencode` binary isn't on PATH in the tmux window's shell (check `echo $PATH` inside tmux)
