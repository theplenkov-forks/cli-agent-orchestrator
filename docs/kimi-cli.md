# Kimi CLI Provider

## Overview

The Kimi CLI provider drives Moonshot AI's coding agent CLI. There are **two
incompatible TUIs** in the wild under the same `kimi` command name, and CAO
supports both from one provider:

| | **Legacy** — `kimi-cli` (MoonshotAI) | **Kimi Code** — `agent-core-v2` |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt | `✨` / `💫` emoji, inline | boxed composer (`╭─ │ > │ ╰─`) |
| Response bullet | `•` (U+2022) | `●` (U+25CF, colour 253) |
| Reasoning style | grey 244 + italic | grey 244 + italic |
| Working indicator | bare moon phase (`🌕`) | braille (`⠙ working…`) |
| Idle tip | — | rotating `🌕 · Tip: …` row |
| Agent profile | YAML, `extend: default` | Markdown, `${base_prompt}` |
| MCP config | `--mcp-config '<json>'` | **no flag** — user-level `mcp.json` only |
| Unattended flag | `--yolo` (auto-approves all confirmations) | `--auto` (Never Ask) |
| Working directory | per-worker temp dir (`cd`) | the terminal's real cwd |
| Concurrency | one instance per directory (lock) | no per-directory lock |
| Timeout config | mutates `~/.kimi/config.toml` | launch-scoped `KIMI_MCP_*_TIMEOUT_MS` |

Dialect selection is capability-based: CAO never infers a dialect from a
version number. The CODE path was validated end-to-end against Kimi Code
**0.43.1**. (A later local install, Kimi Code 2.0.0, still exposes the same
capability flags in `--help`; that is a limited observation, not full
2.0.0 TUI/E2E support.)

## Prerequisites

- **Kimi CLI**: legacy — `brew install kimi-cli` or `uv tool install kimi-cli`.
  Kimi Code — installs itself under `~/.kimi-code/bin/kimi`.
- **Authentication**: legacy — `kimi login`. Kimi Code — `kimi login`
  (device-code flow).
- **tmux 3.3+**

Verify installation:

```bash
kimi --version
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Authenticate
kimi login

# Launch with CAO
cao launch --agents code_supervisor --provider kimi_cli
```

The dialect is detected automatically; no configuration selects it.

## Native Swarm Mode

Kimi Code profiles can set `kimiSwarm: true` to enter native swarm mode before
the first task, or `kimiSwarm: false` to skip automatic activation. Omission
inherits the operator's `CAO_KIMI_SWARM_DEFAULT` setting, which is off unless
explicitly enabled. This is a mode setting: it does not add `AgentSwarm` or any
other tool to a native `tools` allowlist. A read-only profile keeps its existing
runtime tool restrictions.

`kimiSwarmMaxConcurrency` accepts integers from 1 to 10. The operator's bounded
runtime policy defaults to 10 concurrent subagents per `AgentSwarm` batch, not
10 total subagents over the session and not a shared budget across CAO workers.
A smaller limit captured from the launch shell is preserved. Setting
`kimiSwarm: false` does not bypass that resource policy; tool-triggered swarms
remain capped when their tool is available.

The native Kimi 2.1.1 retry scheduler did not enforce its environment concurrency
limit after provider rate limits. Enabling this policy therefore requires an
executable whose retry path has been fixed and tested. Set
`CAO_KIMI_SWARM_CAP_SHA256` on the CAO server to that executable's SHA256, and set
`CAO_KIMI_SWARM_DEFAULT=1` to enable startup swarm by default. CAO verifies the
actual launch-shell-resolved executable before every managed native launch and
refuses a replacement that does not match. An explicit profile limit also
requires verification. Unconfigured default-off launches retain their prior
behavior without claiming an enforced cap.

CAO runs `/swarm on` as a startup control command and requires Kimi's native
activation confirmation before delivering work. It does not count this command
or its status bullet as an executed task. Legacy Kimi CLI behavior is unchanged.

For completion attribution, CAO retains the current generation's raw transcript
in an anonymous spool, using at most 64 KiB before spilling to temporary disk.
It closes the spool on the next dispatch, buffer-generation reset, or terminal
cleanup. This preserves quoted and private-output ownership after the rolling
buffer is cropped. Final-answer verification may temporarily read the complete
generation, so very large turns require disk and transient memory proportional
to that turn's output. If recording fails, CAO discards cached completion
evidence and requires a new generation before trusting a final-answer proof.
An active live panel takes precedence over an older recorded completion.

## Dialect Detection

The provider probes the resolved `kimi` binary's `--help` **once per binary
identity** and classifies it from its capability flags:

| Dialect | Capability flags (any one) |
|---|---|
| Legacy | `--mcp-config`, `--mcp-config-file` |
| Kimi Code | `--auto`, `--agent-file`, `--output-format` |

Rules that matter:

- **Never a version string.** A version string is a claim; an option table is a
  fact. Kimi Code and `kimi-cli` share the `kimi` command name and have shipped
  under overlapping version numbers.
- **Whole-token matching.** `--agent` must not match `--agent-file`.
- **Fail closed.** An unrecognised option table yields `UNKNOWN`, and the
  provider refuses to launch rather than guessing.
- **Successful probes only are cached**, keyed on
  `(absolute path, st_mtime_ns, st_size)`. An `UNKNOWN` verdict must not become
  sticky — a transient PATH problem at boot would otherwise disable the
  provider for the life of the process.
- The probe runs **in the launch shell's environment** and its absolute binary
  path is reused verbatim for `exec`. Probing one PATH while tmux launches
  another is the PR #664 bug class.
- **Nothing dynamic is ever quoted for the pane shell.** Both the probe program
  and the launch line are POSIX text, and POSIX quoting is not fish quoting:
  `shlex.quote` renders an embedded apostrophe as `'\''`, which `fish` ends early
  when a backslash precedes it (`Unexpected end of string`, exit 127), and `\\`
  means one backslash in `fish` but two in POSIX `sh`. CAO therefore writes the
  POSIX text to a script in a scratch directory whose path is drawn from a
  shell-safe alphabet, and types only a fixed, quote-free invocation
  (`/bin/sh <script> [<probe file>]`). The pane's shell — whatever it is — has
  nothing to expand, split or unquote, and an operator temp root with hostile
  characters falls back to a safe one rather than being transported.
- The probe program is executed by an explicitly selected `/bin/sh` started as a
  child of the pane shell, because the pane shell is the operator's choice:
  `fish` cannot parse `${VAR:-default}` and would fail before reporting anything.
  The child inherits the pane's `PATH`, `HOME` and `KIMI_CODE_HOME`, so
  `command -v kimi` still observes exactly what the launched `kimi` will see,
  and probe and exec still refer to the same file.

## Kimi Code Path

### Working Directory

The terminal's own working directory *is* Kimi's cwd. The provider deliberately
emits **no `cd`**: git-root resolution, repository `AGENTS.md` discovery,
project MCP discovery and the session namespace all depend on it. The legacy
temp-cwd workaround exists to dodge a per-directory lock that Kimi Code does
not have.

### Per-Worker `KIMI_CODE_HOME`

`KIMI_CODE_HOME` (default `~/.kimi-code`) is the **only** redirect Kimi Code
exposes for MCP membership — there is no launch-scoped MCP flag and no
MCP-config env override. Per-worker MCP isolation therefore means per-worker
home:

```
worker A -> <provider_temp>/kimi-home A -> mcp.json A
worker B -> <provider_temp>/kimi-home B -> mcp.json B
```

A single shared home is **not** a valid substitute: two CAO profiles may declare
different `mcpServers` surfaces (worker A: `cao` + `github`; worker B: `cao` +
`postgres`), and one `mcp.json` cannot represent both.

The runtime home is built from the *effective source home* — resolved from the
same launch shell that resolved the `kimi` binary, never from `cao-server`'s own
environment, which can differ.

**Copied** (allowlist, never a denylist, so a future Kimi release that invents a
new runtime-state directory cannot leak it into every worker):

| Kind | Entries |
|---|---|
| Files | `config.toml`, `tui.toml`, `AGENTS.md`, `mcp.json` |
| Directories | `skills/`, `plugins/`, `credentials/` |
| Snapshot | `workspace-trust/` (see below — security input, not ordinary state) |

`config.toml` and `mcp.json` are written `0600`; `credentials/` is copied `0600`
per file; the home itself is `0700`.

**Not copied.** Session, log, update, cache and telemetry state stay behind, so N
workers cannot corrupt each other's sessions or share a conversation index.
`iter_forbidden_runtime_state()` exists so tests can prove this.

**`workspace-trust/` is snapshotted** (A4). It is neither ordinary runtime state
nor ordinary user semantics: it records decisions the operator already made in
normal Kimi, and Kimi consults it to decide whether to raise the trust dialog at
all. Leaving it behind re-asked a question the operator had already answered, on
every terminal, which left the server-wide opt-in as the only unattended path.

The store is copied as **opaque bytes** — CAO never parses, keys, or regenerates
the record schema, because only Kimi decides what "trusted" means. The runtime
copy is a real directory of real files, so records Kimi writes during a worker's
life land only in the disposable home. Copy policy:

| Source shape | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| real directory | recursive snapshot; dirs `0700`, records `0600` |
| top-level symlink | **refused** — nothing inherited, warning logged |
| not a directory | refused, warning logged |
| symlink inside the store | that entry is skipped (never materialised, never followed) |

The refusals are deliberate: following a symlinked trust store would adopt
whatever store it points at, which may not be the user's, and a retained link
inside the snapshot is a path back out of it. A refused store simply means the
worker falls through to the normal trust policy below.

**`bin/` is referenced, not copied** — it holds Kimi's self-managed ~175 MB
binary, which every CAO-managed worker runs with auto-update disabled. Known,
accepted risk: it is the one entry that can still reach back into the real home,
and if the source `bin/` is itself a symlink the runtime home gets a
link-to-a-link.

**Symlinked preserve-entries.** If `skills/`, `plugins/` or `credentials/` is a
top-level symlink, the target's *contents* are copied and the link is never
reproduced, so nothing can be written back through it. A link whose target is
not a directory, or which points at the source home or any of its ancestors, is
refused, logged, and recorded in `skipped_dirs` — the home still builds, so a
pathological link degrades one entry rather than blocking the launch. Links
*inside* a preserved tree are copied as links and never walked through.
`workspace-trust/` deliberately does **not** follow that rule — see above.

`cleanup()` removes exactly `<provider_temp>/kimi-home`, and unlinks a
symlinked home rather than following it.

### Workspace Trust — inherit one, or opt in to all

Kimi Code refuses to run in an untrusted folder. Measured against 0.43.1:

| Selection | Result |
|---|---|
| **Don't trust** | **the process exits immediately** (exit 0). No TUI, no turn. |
| **Trust this folder** | full function; trust recorded for that folder |

Because the dialog fires for **any** untrusted cwd — even a repository with no
project MCP files — and because CAO builds a fresh `KIMI_CODE_HOME` per
terminal, trust is not optional for a working worker.

But *granting* trust is a security decision, because trusting a folder:

- **starts that repository's project MCP servers** — arbitrary commands read
  straight out of the checkout (both `.mcp.json` and `.kimi-code/mcp.json` are
  discovered), and
- **loads that repository's project `AGENTS.md`**, i.e. instructions.

A worker launched in a folder the operator does not control would otherwise
execute that folder's commands with no human in the loop. **CAO does not grant
trust by default.** It refuses to answer the dialog and fails the terminal with
an actionable error naming the folder.

There are two supported ways to resolve it, and they are not equivalent.

#### Option A — pre-trust one workspace (preferred)

Run normal `kimi` once in that repository, using your usual `KIMI_CODE_HOME`,
and choose **Trust this folder**:

```bash
cd /path/to/repo && kimi      # then choose "Trust this folder"
```

Kimi records the decision in `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/workspace-trust/`. Every later CAO
terminal in that folder **inherits the record through the runtime-home
snapshot**, so Kimi sees the folder as already trusted and raises no dialog —
CAO never has to decide anything. This is the narrow choice: it trusts exactly
the repositories you reviewed.

#### Option B — server-level auto-trust (broader)

Set in the **cao-server** environment:

```bash
CAO_KIMI_CODE_TRUST_WORKSPACE=1
```

This permits CAO to answer the dialog itself, granting trust to **whatever
folder a terminal is launched in** — including folders you have never reviewed.
That is strictly broader than Option A, so it is not the recommended default;
prefer Option A unless you routinely launch terminals in folders you have not
pre-trusted.

Accepted truthy values are `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` (case-insensitive,
whitespace-trimmed). Every other value — including unset, `0`, `false` and a
typo — means "do not grant", so a mistake fails closed.

The variable is CAO's own policy knob and is **not** exported to Kimi: 0.43.1
exposes no `--trust` flag, and its trust record
(`$KIMI_CODE_HOME/workspace-trust/wd_<name>_<sha256[:12]>`, containing
`{"root": …, "trustedAt": …}`) is an undocumented on-disk format that CAO treats
as opaque.

#### What happens in each case

| Source home says | Opt-in | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| folder already trusted | unset | no dialog; Kimi runs; CAO decides nothing |
| folder not trusted | unset | dialog; CAO sends no key; terminal fails with the error below |
| folder not trusted | `=1` | dialog; CAO identifies it positively and accepts |
| trust store is a symlink | either | nothing inherited; falls through to the rows above |

When opted in, the handler is still **positive-identification only**: the exact
dialog must be present (title + navigation hint + a recognised option set), the
workspace the dialog names must equal the pane's actual working directory, and
the selection must be readable. If the selection is already *Trust this folder*
it is accepted; otherwise CAO navigates deterministically, re-reads the pane,
verifies the marker moved, and only then sends Enter. Any other outcome —
unknown layout, unreadable selection, mismatched workspace — fails closed
without sending a key. A blind Enter is never sent.

In either case the trust record Kimi writes during the run lands **only in the
disposable runtime home**. The real `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/workspace-trust/` is never
written by a CAO worker, so Option B stays a per-launch behaviour rather than a
silent mutation of your persistent trust store.

### MCP Server Configuration

There is no launch-scoped MCP flag in Kimi Code. Profile MCP servers are merged
into the runtime home's `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cao-mcp-server": { "command": "…", "args": ["…"] }
  }
}
```

Merge semantics are frozen and deterministic:

- **A profile server overrides a user-level server of the same name.** The
  profile is the explicitly selected, launch-specific configuration; the user
  file is ambient.
- Every profile entry passes through `resolve_mcp_server_config`, so a bundled
  `cao-mcp-server` becomes a PATH-independent invocation exactly as on the
  legacy path.
- `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` is **not** injected per server. Kimi Code's stdio MCP
  children inherit the parent environment, so the launch line exports it once
  for every server, including user-level ones. An explicit `env` block on a
  profile server is preserved verbatim, including an explicit `CAO_TERMINAL_ID`.

### MCP Timeouts — milliseconds

Kimi Code binds `[mcp] startup_timeout_ms` / `[mcp] tool_timeout_ms` from
`config.toml` **or** these launch-scoped env vars. Per-server
`startupTimeoutMs` / `toolTimeoutMs` override them.

CAO sets, on the launch line:

| Binding | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KIMI_MCP_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | 60 s — 2× Kimi's own 30 s default, enough for a cold `cao-mcp-server` import |
| `KIMI_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` | 600 s — CAO's legacy handoff budget, preserved |

Both are **milliseconds**, verified against Kimi Code 0.43.1's bundled source
rather than assumed: the env bindings are read through a parser whose body is
`Number(raw)`, accepted only when
`Number.isInteger(parsed) && parsed >= 1 && parsed <= 2147483647`, and the
schema is `McpTimeoutMsSchema = number().int().min(1).max(2147483647)`.

A profile's single `timeout` field is mapped onto both per-server fields and
clamped to `1 … 2147483647`; the `timeout` key itself is dropped, since it is
not part of Kimi's server schema. An out-of-range env value is silently ignored
by Kimi and falls back to the config default — which is why CAO always sets
both explicitly.

### Agent Profiles

Kimi Code takes a **Markdown** agent file via `--agent-file`, not YAML. CAO
writes a launch-scoped file next to the runtime home:

```markdown
---
name: cao-kimi-<terminal-id>
description: "CAO launch-scoped agent for terminal <terminal-id>"
---

${base_prompt}

<CAO's system prompt>
```

`${base_prompt}` is emitted **before** CAO's own text and is never interpolated
by CAO. It is Kimi Code's own substitution point for the built-in base prompt,
so emitting it first *appends* CAO's instructions to Kimi's base prompt instead
of replacing the whole prompt. Substituting it in CAO would silently drop
Kimi's own instructions — the PR #664 failure class.

The frontmatter `name` must be non-empty kebab-case, which a terminal id is not;
the provider slugifies it to `cao-kimi-<slug>`.

## Legacy Path

Everything in this section applies only when detection resolves to the legacy
`kimi-cli` TUI.

### Status Detection

| Status | Pattern | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **IDLE** | `💫` or `✨` at bottom (optionally prefixed with `username@dirname`) | Prompt visible, ready for input |
| **PROCESSING** | No prompt at bottom | Response is streaming |
| **COMPLETED** | Prompt at bottom + latching flag (user input detected) | Task finished |
| **ERROR** | `Error:`, `APIError:`, `ConnectionError:` patterns | Error detected |

#### Prompt Symbols

- **💫** (dizzy): Thinking mode enabled (default behavior)
- **✨** (sparkle): Thinking mode disabled (`--no-thinking` flag)

The provider matches both symbols using the pattern `(?:\w+@[\w.-]+)?[✨💫]`. The
`username@dirname` prefix is optional to support both v1.20.0+ (bare emoji) and
earlier versions.

### Message Extraction

Response extraction from terminal output (supports two formats):

**v1.20.0+ (inline prompt format):**
1. Find the last prompt-with-input line (`💫 message text`)
2. Collect all content between that line and the next bare prompt (`💫`)
3. Filter out thinking bullets (gray ANSI-styled `•` lines)

**Pre-v1.20.0 (input box format):**
1. Find the last user input box (bordered with `╭─` / `╰─`)
2. Collect all content between the box end and the next prompt
3. Filter out thinking bullets

**Fallback** (long responses where markers scroll out of capture): Extract all
content up to the last idle prompt, filtering out TUI chrome.

### Thinking vs Response Bullets

Both thinking and response lines use the `•` (bullet) prefix. The provider
distinguishes them using ANSI color codes in the raw terminal output:

- **Thinking**: `\x1b[38;5;244m•` (gray color 244 + italic)
- **Response**: plain `•` without an ANSI color prefix

Kimi Code uses `●` in colour 253 for the answer. A 24-bit (`38;2;R;G;B`) bullet
counts as reasoning only when its channels are near-grey (spread ≤ 16); the
measured answer colour 253 is decisive in the other direction. The asymmetry is
deliberate: both of Kimi's own styles are greyscale, so a truecolor row errs
toward *reasoning*, and a misread answer raises an extraction error (loud)
rather than a misread reasoning row leaking silently into the message.

### Agent Profiles

Legacy profiles are **optional**. If provided, the provider:

1. Creates a temporary YAML agent file that extends Kimi's built-in `default`
   agent
2. Writes the system prompt as a separate markdown file
3. Passes the agent file via `--agent-file`

```yaml
version: 1
agent:
  extend: default
  system_prompt_path: ./system.md
```

Temp files are automatically cleaned up when the provider's `cleanup()` method
is called.

### MCP Server Configuration

MCP servers from agent profiles are passed via `--mcp-config` as a JSON string:

```bash
kimi --yolo --mcp-config '{"server-name": {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "cao-mcp-server"]}}'
```

#### Transport selection

Kimi CLI hands each `--mcp-config` document to FastMCP. FastMCP's remote server
model has no `type` field, and when `transport` is absent it infers one from the
URL *path* — `sse` when the path ends in `/sse`, Streamable HTTP otherwise. A
declared SSE server published at `/events` would therefore start as Streamable
HTTP, and a Streamable HTTP server published at `/sse` would start as SSE.

CAO writes FastMCP's `transport` explicitly from an [agent plugin](agent-plugins.md)
server's portable `type`, so the declared protocol is selected rather than guessed
from URL spelling. A `cwd` is passed through unchanged and is honoured by FastMCP
for stdio servers. An entry that carries no `type` — a hand-written profile entry —
is left exactly as written, so FastMCP's own inference still applies to it.

#### MCP Tool Call Timeout

Kimi CLI defaults to a 60-second MCP tool call timeout
(`tool_call_timeout_ms=60000` in `~/.kimi/config.toml`). This is too short for
`handoff` operations, which create a worker terminal, wait for completion, and
extract output — routinely exceeding 60 seconds.

The provider automatically modifies `~/.kimi/config.toml` to set
`tool_call_timeout_ms=600000` when MCP servers are configured, increasing the
timeout to 600 seconds (10 minutes) to match CAO's default handoff timeout. The
original value is restored during `cleanup()`. This is the same
direct-config-write pattern used by the Antigravity CLI provider
(`~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`).

**Why not `--config` flag?** Kimi CLI's `--config` flag causes it to bypass the
default config file (`~/.kimi/config.toml`), which breaks OAuth authentication —
the CLI shows "model: not set" and `/login` refuses to work. Modifying the
config file directly avoids this issue.

Without this override, the supervisor Kimi CLI agent receives a
`ToolError("Timeout while calling MCP tool handoff")` after 60 seconds, even
though the worker is still processing.

Note the contrast with Kimi Code, which needs no config-file mutation at all —
its timeouts travel as launch-scoped env bindings.

#### CAO_TERMINAL_ID Forwarding

Kimi CLI does not automatically forward parent shell environment variables to
MCP subprocesses. The provider explicitly injects `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` into the
`env` field of each MCP server config so that tools like `handoff` and `assign`
can create new agent windows in the same tmux session (instead of creating
separate sessions). Existing `env` entries are preserved, and an existing
`CAO_TERMINAL_ID` value is never overwritten.

### Command Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--yolo` | Auto-approve all tool action confirmations |
| `--agent-file FILE` | Custom agent YAML file |
| `--mcp-config TEXT` | MCP server configuration (JSON, repeatable) |
| `--work-dir DIR` | Set working directory |
| `--no-thinking` | Disable thinking mode (changes prompt to ✨) |

## Implementation Notes

### Provider Lifecycle

**Legacy:**

1. **Initialize**: Create unique temp dir → set MCP timeout in
   `~/.kimi/config.toml` (if MCP servers) → wait for shell → send
   `cd <tempdir> && env -u COLORTERM TERM=xterm-256color kimi --yolo` → wait for
   IDLE or COMPLETED (up to 120s)
2. **Status Detection**: Check bottom 50 lines for idle prompt pattern
   (end-of-line anchored)
3. **Message Extraction**: Line-based approach mapping raw and clean output for
   thinking filtering
4. **Exit**: Send `/exit` command
5. **Cleanup**: Remove temp agent files, restore MCP timeout in `config.toml`,
   reset state

**Kimi Code:**

1. **Initialize**: probe the launch shell for the binary + dialect + source
   `KIMI_CODE_HOME` → build the runtime home and merge MCP servers → launch
   `env -u COLORTERM KIMI_CODE_HOME=… CAO_TERMINAL_ID=… TERM=xterm-256color
   KIMI_MCP_*_TIMEOUT_MS=… KIMI_*_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 <binary> --auto [--model M]
   [--agent-file P]` in the terminal's real cwd → answer the workspace-trust
   dialog (opt-in only) and the upgrade reminder → wait for IDLE or COMPLETED
2. **Status Detection**: buffer path and rendered-screen path, both sharing one
   classifier
3. **Message Extraction**: region located by layout (the composer sits *below*
   the transcript), rows classified by the shared classifier
4. **Cleanup**: remove the temp dir and the runtime home

### Status Detection Details (both dialects)

Readiness on the Kimi Code TUI is the status bar / context footer. A turn is
in flight when a **braille** indicator is present; under Kimi Code semantics a
moon is not evidence of work, because that dialect rotates moons through its
*idle* tip row. The legacy bare-moon signal is preserved unchanged.

Two independent paths exist and must agree:

- `get_status(output)` — the raw rolling buffer. It strips pipe-pane escapes
  first, so the bottom-anchored checks see line-oriented text.
- `get_status_from_screen(screen_lines)` — a pyte-composited viewport of
  **escape-free** rows. Enabled via `supports_screen_detection = True` /
  `CAO_PYTE_STATUS`. Because the rows carry no styling, no rule here may depend
  on ANSI.

A response bullet latches "input received", so a long response that scrolls its
bullets out of the buffer still reads COMPLETED rather than IDLE. Nothing
latches at init, so a freshly-launched terminal reads IDLE. A bullet only
counts when it carries a **payload**: on a narrow terminal the status bar wraps
and a row can begin with a bare `●` or `•` followed by punctuation (`●)`).
Matching that as assistant output latched a terminal that had never been sent
anything and reported it COMPLETED. Both dialects therefore share one bullet
rule, `BULLET_ANY_RE = ^[^\S\n]*[•●][^\S\n]+`.

Chrome classification is **structural**, never substring-based. A row is boot
chrome or footer chrome because of its measured shape — whole-row anchoring, the
frame colour, the segment count — not because it mentions boot vocabulary. This
matters because `_locate_response_region()` uses those rows as end anchors, so a
substring rule truncates any answer that quotes them:

```
● First line
connecting to mcp servers is only a phrase   <- must survive
Final line                                   <- must survive
```

Boot-message punctuation/whitespace suffixes are separate from arbitrary
detail fields. Where a detail field accepts a trailing-newline suffix, the
newline boundary prevents the two fields from repeatedly matching the same
whitespace. MCP count digits and optional collapsed-output bullets likewise
avoid overlapping repetitions. Existing punctuation, Unicode whitespace,
trailing-newline behavior, and both bullet glyphs remain accepted; this does
not add a transcript-length limit or change the distinction between answer
content and chrome.

Footer tips are checked within individual escape-delimited segments carrying
the footer colour; a later colour or reset cannot lend its text to an earlier
segment. Native swarm status parsing matches the existing glyph/state prefix
and reads its detail separately, without overlapping whitespace repetitions.
It rejects embedded newlines at the row boundary while preserving the panel,
colour, and quoted-content checks.

### Terminal Output Format (v1.20.0+, legacy)

```
╭────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Welcome to Kimi Code CLI!                              │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
💫 create a function
• [thinking] Let me create the function...
• Here is the function:

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

💫
```

### Kimi CLI v1.20.0 Compatibility

The provider handles several v1.20.0 behavioral changes:

- **Prompt format**: Changed from `user@dirname💫` to bare `💫`. The idle
  pattern uses an optional prefix.
- **Input display**: Removed bordered input boxes (`╭─...╰─`). User input now
  appears inline on the prompt line (`💫 message text`).
- **TERM variable**: Kimi CLI silently exits when `TERM=tmux-256color` (the tmux
  default). The provider overrides with `TERM=xterm-256color`.
- **Colour depth**: the extractor's palette is measured (reasoning 244, final
  answer 253, submitted input 222). When the inherited environment advertises
  24-bit colour the TUI renders `38;2;r;g;b` instead, and the answer bullet
  becomes a near-grey the reasoning rule reads as reasoning, so extraction
  degrades. Both dialects therefore unset `COLORTERM` for the launch, exactly as
  they pin `TERM`.
- **Per-directory lock**: Only one Kimi instance can run in a given directory.
  Each provider instance uses its own temp directory via `cd`.

## E2E Testing

```bash
# Run all Kimi CLI E2E tests
uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/ -v -k kimi_cli

# Run specific test type
uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/test_handoff.py -v -k kimi_cli
uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/test_assign.py -v -k kimi_cli
uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/test_send_message.py -v -k kimi_cli
uv run pytest -m e2e test/e2e/test_supervisor_orchestration.py -v -k KimiCli -o "addopts="
```

Prerequisites for E2E tests:
- CAO server running (`cao-server`)
- `kimi` CLI authenticated (`kimi login`)
- Agent profiles installed (`cao install developer`)
- For Kimi Code: pre-trust the test repo in normal Kimi (Option A, preferred), or
  set `CAO_KIMI_CODE_TRUST_WORKSPACE=1` in the server environment (Option B) — see
  *Workspace Trust* above

## Troubleshooting

### Kimi CLI not detected

```bash
# Verify kimi is on PATH (command is `kimi`, not `kimi-cli`)
which kimi
kimi --version
```

### Dialect resolves to UNKNOWN

The provider refuses to launch rather than guess. Confirm the binary's option
table is intact:

```bash
kimi --help    # expect --auto / --agent-file, or --mcp-config
```

An `UNKNOWN` verdict is never cached, so fixing the binary is enough — no
restart of `cao-server` is required for the retry.

### "Kimi Code is asking to trust this folder and CAO will not answer it"

Working as intended. The folder is not trusted in your real `KIMI_CODE_HOME`.
Either pre-trust that one repository in normal Kimi (Option A, preferred — the
decision is inherited and the prompt does not come back), or set
`CAO_KIMI_CODE_TRUST_WORKSPACE=1` in the cao-server environment and restart it
(Option B — broader, trusts whatever folder a terminal launches in). See
*Workspace Trust* for why neither is automatic.

If you *did* pre-trust the folder and still see this, check that the trust store
was inheritable: a `workspace-trust` that is itself a symlink is refused by
design, and the provider log will contain
`kimi_runtime_home_trust_skip reason=top-level-symlink`.

### Trust dialog answered but the terminal still times out

The handler fails closed on a workspace mismatch: the folder Kimi names must
equal the pane's actual working directory. Check the provider log for
`kimi_trust_pane_cwd_unavailable` or the workspace-mismatch message.

### Authentication issues

```bash
# Re-authenticate
kimi login
```

### Initialization timeout

If Kimi CLI takes too long to start, check:
- Network connectivity (Kimi requires API access)
- Authentication status (`kimi login`)
- The provider waits up to 120 seconds for initialization
- For Kimi Code, whether a project MCP server is hanging startup — bound by
  `KIMI_MCP_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` (60 s)

### Status bar not detected

The provider checks the bottom 50 lines for the idle prompt
(`IDLE_PROMPT_TAIL_LINES = 50`). This accounts for Kimi's TUI padding lines
between the prompt and the status bar, which varies with terminal height (e.g.,
a 46-row terminal has ~32 empty padding lines). If Kimi's TUI layout changes
significantly, this constant may need adjustment.

### A finished answer is extracted as empty or raises an extraction error

Extraction raises `OutputExtractionError` rather than returning something
plausible but wrong. Two common causes:

- every candidate row looked like reasoning — CAO refuses to return private
  reasoning as the agent's message;
- the answer quoted TUI chrome and a region anchor landed inside it. This is
  covered by regression tests; if it recurs, the row shape has changed and the
  shared classifier in `providers/kimi_transcript.py` needs the new measurement.
